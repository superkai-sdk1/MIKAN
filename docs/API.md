# MIKAN STUDIO — API contract (v1)

This document is the single source of truth shared by the server (`server/`) and the iOS app (`ios/`).
If the implementation must deviate, update this file in the same change.

## Conventions

- Base URL: `https://<host>/api` (production default host: `95-170-124-192.sslip.io`; local dev: `http://localhost:3000/api`).
- Auth: every endpoint except `POST /api/auth/login` and `GET /api/health` requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
  A token of a deactivated employee is rejected with `401`.
- JSON, `camelCase` keys. Omitted optional fields and `null` mean the same thing on input; the server always outputs every field (using `null`).
- IDs: integers. Telegram chat IDs: integers (int64, fit in a JS double).
- Instants: ISO 8601 UTC strings with milliseconds, e.g. `"2026-10-15T11:00:00.000Z"`.
- Calendar dates (birthday, report days): `"YYYY-MM-DD"`.
- Money: **integer rubles** (no kopecks) everywhere.
- Phones are normalized by the server: Russian numbers (`8XXXXXXXXXX`, `7XXXXXXXXXX`, `+7 (XXX) XXX-XX-XX`, `9XXXXXXXXX`) → `+7XXXXXXXXXX`; anything else → `+` followed by digits.
- Lists: `{ "items": [...] }`. Paginated lists (`?limit=&offset=`, default limit 50, max 200) add `"total"`.
- Errors: non-2xx with body
  ```json
  { "error": { "code": "validation_error", "message": "Текст для пользователя на русском" } }
  ```
  Codes: `unauthorized` (401), `forbidden` (403), `not_found` (404), `validation_error` (400),
  `conflict` (409), `insufficient_stock` (409), `schedule_conflict` (409), `rate_limited` (429),
  `payment_provider_error` (502, the bank did not answer), `upstream_error` (502, an external service such as AI
  image generation failed), `internal` (500).
  `message` is always human-readable Russian; the app shows it as is.
- Roles: every employee has a `role` (`owner` | `admin` | `master`, see «Roles»); a request beyond it → `403 forbidden`
  with a Russian message («Это доступно владельцу студии», «Можно менять только свои записи»).
- Idempotency: `POST /sales`, `POST /sales/:id/refund`, `POST /receipts`, `POST /cash/operations`,
  `POST /products/:id/movements`, `POST /products/:id/movements/batch`, `POST /products/:id/purchases`
  and the prepayment writes `POST /appointments/:id/deposit`, `…/deposit/refund`, `…/deposit/retain` accept an optional `Idempotency-Key: <UUID>` header
  (so does the public `POST /public/booking`, without an employee — see «Online booking»). The app generates one key per user action and resends the
  same key when it retries that action (timeout, dropped connection, repeated tap after an unclear outcome).
  - The first request with a key runs normally; its successful response is stored for **24 h**, scoped to the
    employee (key + endpoint + employee + response).
  - A repeat with the same key, endpoint and body (key order and key case do not matter) does **not** run again:
    the server returns the stored response with `200` and the header `Idempotent-Replayed: true`.
  - The same key with a different body or endpoint → `409 conflict`
    («Повторный запрос отличается от исходного. Обновите экран и попробуйте снова.»).
  - Errors are not stored: a failed request changed nothing, so retrying it with the same key runs it again.
  - A malformed key → `400 validation_error`. Without the header the endpoints behave as before (no deduplication).

## Entities

### Employee
```json
{ "id": 1, "name": "Анна", "login": "anna", "phone": "+79991234567", "color": "#FF7A1A",
  "isMaster": true, "role": "master", "active": true, "createdAt": "..." }
```
`color` — hex used for the master's appointments in the calendar. `isMaster` — performs procedures (shows in master pickers).
`role` — what the employee may do (see «Roles»); independent of `isMaster` (an owner may also be a master).

### Roles
Three roles; the server checks every request (the app only hides what a role can't use).
- `owner` — everything. The only role that manages employees (create, edit others, roles, deactivate), pay rules,
  payroll of others and adjustments, and reads the audit log.
- `admin` — everything except what is owner-only above.
- `master` — sees the whole calendar and all clients; creates, edits, moves and cancels **only their own
  appointments** (`masterId` = themselves: creating for another master, editing another master's appointment or
  giving theirs to another master → `403` «Можно менять только свои записи»), and the prepayment operations of their
  own appointments. Completes **any** appointment (`POST /appointments/:id/complete` — completing a visit is a till
  action, e.g. at checkout, so the aftercare memo goes out). Full POS and cash register (receipts, sales, refunds,
  shifts, cash operations, QR), the dashboard, clients (read, create, edit, Telegram link), bot chats (read, reply,
  mark read, `needsAttention`), scheduled messages and booking requests, their own staff code. Reads the catalog,
  products, stock and settings but does not change them; no reports, analytics or campaigns.

| Area | owner | admin | master |
|---|---|---|---|
| Employees: list | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Employees: create, edit others, role, active | ✓ | — | — |
| Own profile: name, phone, color, password (`PATCH /employees/:me`) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Appointments (create, edit, move, cancel) & prepayments | ✓ | ✓ | own only |
| Completing a visit (`POST /appointments/:id/complete`, e.g. at checkout) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| POS, sales, refunds, cash, QR, dashboard | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Loyalty at the till: paying with bonuses, selling and redeeming gift certificates, reading bonuses and certificates, editing a certificate's recipient and note, sending it | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Bonus adjustments (`POST /clients/:id/bonuses`) | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| Certificates: cancel, change the expiry (`expiresAt` in `PATCH /certificates/:id`) | ✓ | — | — |
| Clients, history | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Duplicate cards: list, dismiss, merge (`/clients/duplicates…`, `POST /clients/:id/merge`) | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| Services, products, categories, aftercare templates, stock movements, purchases, revisions, image generation: write | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| Reports and analytics (`/reports/*`) | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| Settings (studio, bot), knowledge base, staff chat binding (`PUT/DELETE /bot/chats/:chatId/employee`), `POST /bot/test`: write | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| Work schedules: read | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Work schedules: change | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| Payroll: own statement and own pay rules (read) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Payroll: others, pay rules (write), adjustments | ✓ | — | — |
| Telegram campaigns (`/campaigns…`, read and write) | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| Portfolio (`/portfolio…`): read | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Portfolio: add, edit, reorder, delete photos | ✓ | ✓ | own only |
| Audit log | ✓ | — | — |

Everything not listed (reads of catalog, settings, uploads, QR config, …) is open to every role. Rules:
- At least one active `owner` must remain: demoting or deactivating the last one → `400` «В студии должен остаться
  хотя бы один владелец». Nobody changes their own `role` or deactivates themselves.
- The role is read from the database on every request: a change applies at once, no new login needed.
- Bot staff mode follows the role: the `analytics` tool answers a master «Отчёты доступны владельцу и
  администратору»; the other staff tools are read-only and open to all.
- Existing staff after the update: the first account (created at install) is `owner`, masters are `master`, the rest
  `admin`; the owner adjusts roles in the app. A new employee defaults to `master` when `isMaster`, else `admin`.

### WorkSchedule (графики мастеров)
```json
{ "employeeId": 3,
  "weekly": [ { "start": "11:00", "end": "20:00", "breaks": [ { "start": "14:00", "end": "14:30" } ] },
              null, { "start": "12:00", "end": "21:00", "breaks": [] }, null, null, null, null ],
  "days": [ { "date": "2026-10-23", "off": true, "start": null, "end": null, "breaks": [], "note": "Отпуск" } ] }
```
- `weekly` — 7 entries Monday…Sunday: `null` = day off, else working hours `"HH:MM"` in the studio timezone (`end`
  later than `start`, `"24:00"` = midnight) with `breaks` inside them (non-overlapping). `weekly: null` = no own
  schedule: the employee works the studio hours (`workdayStart`–`workdayEnd`) every day — today's behaviour.
- `days` — exceptions for single dates (vacation, sick day, other hours): `off: true`, or own `start`/`end`/`breaks`.
  An exception wins over `weekly`. `GET` returns exceptions from today on (past ones with `?from=`).
- **Working time** of a date = its exception, else its `weekly` entry, else the studio hours; minus breaks.
- Effects:
  - The bot offers and accepts only the master's working time (free slots, `reschedule_appointment`); a master off
    that day is not offered.
  - Creating or moving an appointment (app) outside the master's working time — a day off, outside the hours, into a
    break — → `409 schedule_conflict` «Фатима не работает 23 октября» / «Фатима работает 21 октября с 12:00 до 21:00» /
    «У Фатимы перерыв 14:00–14:30» unless `force: true` (same flag as the overlap check). A name the server cannot
    decline safely (several words, «-ь», Latin) reads «Анна Иванова: перерыв 14:00–14:30». A move = a new `startsAt` /
    `endsAt` or another `masterId`; status changes and edits that keep the time are not checked. Only dates with an
    own schedule (`source` `weekly` or `day`) are checked: the studio hours never restrict.
  - The app's calendar shades each master's non-working time and marks masters off for the day.
  - The morning staff digest lists who works today with hours («👥 Сегодня работают: Амина 11:00–20:00, Фатима
    12:00–21:00»; masters without an own schedule with the studio hours; «Сегодня никто из мастеров не работает» when
    all are off), when any master has an own schedule for today.

### PayRules (правила зарплаты)
```json
{ "salaryMonthly": 0, "perDay": 1500,
  "servicePercent": 40, "categoryPercent": { "tattoo": 50, "piercing": null, "other": null },
  "productPercent": 10, "deductMaterials": true }
```
All optional numbers default to 0 / `null`; percents 0…100, money ≥ 0 (integer rubles).
- `salaryMonthly` — fixed pay per month, counted per day: each day of the period earns `salaryMonthly / days in that
  month` (a whole month earns exactly `salaryMonthly`).
- `perDay` — for each studio day on which the employee completed at least one visit (as master) or made a sale.
- `servicePercent` — share of the **service revenue of their completed visits** (their `masterId`): the service lines
  of the non-refunded sales of those visits, after the sale discount (split proportionally like analytics).
  Bonus payments count as discount here too; gift certificate lines are not revenue (paying with a certificate is).
  `categoryPercent` overrides it per service category (`null` = use `servicePercent`).
- `deductMaterials` — the cost of consumables written off for the visit (usage movements × the product's unit cost)
  is subtracted from that visit's service revenue before the percent (never below 0).
- `productPercent` — share of the goods and jewelry revenue they sold: product lines of non-refunded sales, attributed
  to the visit's master when the sale belongs to an appointment, else to the employee who made the sale.
- Rules are versioned by `effectiveFrom` (studio date): each visit, sale and day is counted by the version in force
  that day. Days before the first version earn nothing.

### PayrollStatement (расчётный лист)
```json
{ "employee": { EmployeeRef }, "from": "2026-10-01", "to": "2026-10-31",
  "services": { "visits": 42, "revenue": 210000, "materials": 6300, "amount": 81480 },
  "products": { "revenue": 35000, "amount": 3500 },
  "salary": 0, "days": 18, "perDay": 27000,
  "adjustments": { "bonus": 5000, "penalty": 0, "advance": 20000, "payout": 0 },
  "earned": 116980, "paid": 20000, "due": 96980 }
```
`from`/`to` — studio-local dates, inclusive. `earned` = services + products + salary + perDay + bonus − penalty;
`paid` = advance + payout; `due` = earned − paid. Rounded to whole rubles per line.
The detailed statement adds `"lines"`: `[ { "date", "kind": "service"|"product", "appointmentId", "saleId",
"name", "category", "revenue", "materials", "percent", "amount" } ]` (date ascending) and `"adjustmentItems"`:
`[PayrollAdjustment]` (date ascending).
- A visit counts on its own date (studio date of `startsAt`) with its non-refunded sales, whenever they were paid; a
  product line counts on the day of its sale. `services.visits` — completed visits as master (a refunded one still
  counts, earning nothing); `days` — days worked: a completed visit, or a sale made (refunded later or not).
- Line `materials` — the visit's materials split across its service lines by revenue; `category` — the service
  category (`tattoo` | `piercing` | `other` for custom lines), `null` for products; `percent` — `0` on days before the
  first rules version (the line is shown, earning nothing). Service lines of sales without an appointment earn no
  service percent (no master).

### PayrollAdjustment
```json
{ "id": 1, "employee": { EmployeeRef }, "date": "2026-10-15", "kind": "advance", "amount": 20000,
  "note": "Аванс", "cashOperationId": 31, "createdBy": { EmployeeRef }, "createdAt": "..." }
```
`kind`: `bonus` (премия) | `penalty` (штраф) | `advance` (аванс) | `payout` (выплата); `amount` > 0.

### AuditEntry (журнал действий)
```json
{ "id": 1, "at": "...", "employee": { EmployeeRef } | null, "source": "app",
  "action": "appointment.update", "entity": "appointment", "entityId": 1846,
  "summary": "Запись №1846 (Анна Иванова) перенесена с 20 октября, 14:00 на 21 октября, 15:00",
  "changes": { "startsAt": { "from": "...", "to": "..." } } }
```
`source`: `app` | `bot_staff` | `bot` (a client through the bot) | `online` (a client on the booking page or in the
Mini App) | `system` (the server by itself: automatic prepayment retain, a QR payment confirmed by the bank, an unpaid
online hold released). `employee` is `null` for `bot` and `system`.
`changes` — `{ field: { from, to } }` of what changed (`null` when not applicable); passwords and tokens never appear.

### EmployeeRef / ClientRef / ServiceRef (embedded summaries)
```json
{ "id": 2, "name": "Анна", "color": "#FF7A1A" }                         // EmployeeRef
{ "id": 1, "name": "Иван", "lastName": "Петров", "phone": "+79991234567", "telegramLinked": true } // ClientRef
{ "id": 3, "name": "Прокол мочки", "category": "piercing" }             // ServiceRef
```
`ClientRef.lastName` may be `null`; apps show the client's full name (see Client) wherever they name a client.

### Client
```json
{ "id": 1, "name": "Иван", "lastName": "Петров", "phone": "+79991234567", "instagram": "ivan.p",
  "telegramNick": "ivan_petrov", "birthday": "1995-04-12", "notes": "Аллергия на никель", "source": "instagram",
  "telegramLinked": true, "telegramUsername": "ivanp", "botEnabled": true,
  "archived": false, "createdAt": "...", "updatedAt": "...",
  "marketingOptOut": false, "stats": null, "loyalty": null }
```
- The client card: `name` (first name, required), `lastName`, `birthday`, `phone` (required), `telegramNick`; the
  other fields are optional extras.
- Full name = `name` + `" "` + `lastName` (blank parts skipped): apps show it in lists, appointments, checkout and
  history; the bot and staff notifications use it too. Cards created before last names existed may hold the whole
  name in `name` with `lastName: null`.
- `phone` is required for new clients. It may be `null` only for older cards (e.g. imported from YCLIENTS); such
  cards are read and edited as usual.
- `telegramNick` — the Telegram username typed by staff, without `@` (Latin letters, digits and `_`, 4–32 chars;
  `@nick` and `t.me/nick` are accepted on input). `telegramUsername` is read-only: the username of the linked bot
  chat. Apps show `telegramNick`, falling back to `telegramUsername`.
- `source`: free text; app offers `instagram`, `telegram`, `рекомендация`, `с улицы`, `другое`.
- `botEnabled`: whether the bot may send this client aftercare and reminders.
- `stats` is `null` in lists and filled in `GET /clients/:id`:
  `{ "visits": 3, "totalSpent": 25000, "lastVisitAt": "..." | null, "upcomingAppointments": 1 }`
  (`visits` = completed appointments; `totalSpent` = sum of non-refunded sales totals).
- `marketingOptOut` — the client asked for no news and offers: no campaigns, birthday or win-back messages (service
  messages — reminders, aftercare, booking notices — still go). Set by the client's «🔕 Не присылать новости» button
  in the bot, or by staff on the card.
- `loyalty` is `null` in lists and filled in `GET /clients/:id`: `{ "bonusBalance": 1200, "expiring": { "amount":
  500, "at": "..." } | null, "birthdayDiscount": { "percent": 10, "until": "2026-10-26" } | null }` — `expiring` is the
  nearest burning lot; `birthdayDiscount` while today is inside the client's birthday window (see «Birthday and
  win-back»).

### Service
```json
{ "id": 1, "name": "Соски", "category": "piercing", "group": "Тело",
  "price": 2500, "priceMax": null, "priceFrom": false, "durationMin": 45,
  "description": "Nipple. Прокол проходит через сосок, избегая ареолы",
  "imageUrl": "/uploads/5d2e….jpg", "imagePrompt": "a tasteful front view of a male chest with …",
  "photos": ["/uploads/3f1c….jpg", "/uploads/9a0b….jpg"],
  "variants": [ { "name": "Один", "price": 2500, "durationMin": null },
                { "name": "Два", "price": 4000, "durationMin": 60 } ],
  "depositAmount": 0,
  "aftercareTemplateId": 2, "freshProcedure": true, "healingCheckDays": 7, "jewelryChangeWeeks": 6,
  "jewelryIds": [1, 7], "consumables": [ { "productId": 12, "quantity": 1 }, { "productId": 15, "quantity": 2 } ],
  "active": true, "sort": 0 }
```
- `jewelryIds` — catalog jewelry compatible with the service (the same link as `Product.serviceIds`, edited from either
  side); the bot offers these pieces when a client asks what fits the procedure. `[]` when none.
- `consumables` — the consumption norm of one procedure: consumables (`kind: consumable`) and how many units it
  uses. Completing an appointment deducts the norms of its services (see `complete`); `presence` consumables are
  listed with `quantity: 1` and are never deducted. `[]` when none.
- `freshProcedure` — the service leaves a fresh wound: «Свежий прокол» (piercing), «Свежее тату» (tattoo), «Нужна
  памятка по уходу» (other). Aftercare memos are sent only for appointments with at least one such service (see
  `complete`); a jewelry change, cleaning or consultation keeps it `false`. On create it defaults to whether
  `aftercareTemplateId` is set (older builds do not send it); PATCH without it keeps the value.
- `healingCheckDays` (1…60 or `null`) — the bot asks the client «Как заживает?» that many days after the visit (see
  «Follow-ups» in the Bot section). Migrated services with `freshProcedure` get `7`, others `null`.
- `jewelryChangeWeeks` (1…52 or `null`) — the bot suggests booking a jewelry change (a shorter bar once the swelling is
  gone) that many weeks after the visit. `null` = never (the default).
- `depositAmount`: prepayment required to book this service (whole rubles); `0` — no prepayment. An appointment's
  `depositRequired` defaults to the sum over its lines' catalog services (a service booked twice counts twice).
- `category`: `tattoo` | `piercing` | `other` (drives the default aftercare template and icons).
- `group`: the service's catalog category inside `category` («Лицо», «Ухо», «Тело», «Доп. услуги», …) or `null` —
  a `CatalogCategory` of section `service` (see below); lists are grouped by category, then group in the categories'
  order.
- Price: `price` — base / minimal price (the default amount of a booked line); `priceMax` — optional upper bound;
  `priceFrom` — the final price is set per appointment. The server stores `priceFrom = true` whenever `priceMax`
  is set; `priceMax` must be greater than `price`. Display:
  - `priceMax` set: `price > 0` → «от 2 000 до 5 000 ₽», `price = 0` → «до 10 000 ₽»;
  - otherwise `priceFrom` → «от 15 000 ₽», `price = 0` → «Бесплатно», else «2 500 ₽».
- `imageUrl`: the schematic cover picture (upload path) shown in the catalog, POS and the service card, and sent by
  the bot when it consults a client about this service; `null` when none. Cover shown by apps = `imageUrl` ??
  `photos[0]` ?? category icon.
- `imagePrompt`: what the cover picture shows (subject text used to generate it; any language), or `null` —
  then generation uses the service name, category and description.
- `photos`: up to 12 upload paths (`/uploads/…`, from `POST /uploads`) — photos of real works; `[]` when none.
- `variants`: up to 20 priced options (`name` 1–100 chars, `price`, optional `durationMin` overriding the service
  duration); `[]` when none. Booking a service with variants books one variant: the line name is
  `"<service name> — <variant name>"` and its price/duration come from the variant.

### AftercareTemplate
```json
{ "id": 1, "name": "Уход за татуировкой", "category": "tattoo",
  "steps": [ { "dayOffset": 0, "text": "..." }, { "dayOffset": 1, "text": "..." }, { "dayOffset": 7, "text": "..." } ],
  "createdAt": "...", "updatedAt": "..." }
```
`dayOffset: 0` is sent a few minutes after the appointment is completed; `dayOffset: N > 0` is sent N days later at
`botSettings.aftercareHour` (studio local time).

### CatalogCategory
```json
{ "id": 4, "section": "jewelry", "serviceCategory": null, "name": "Лабрет", "position": 0, "itemCount": 12 }
```
The warehouse has four sections: `jewelry` (Украшения), `service` (Услуги), `consumable` (Расходники) and `goods`
(Товары). Each section has its own categories in staff order (`position`, 0-based); service categories exist per
service `category` (`serviceCategory`: `tattoo` | `piercing` | `other`; `null` for product sections).
- Items link to a category by name: `Product.category` (in the section of its `kind`) and `Service.group` (in its
  `category`). Saving an item with a category name matching an existing one (case- and «ё»-insensitive) stores that
  category's spelling; a new name creates the category at the end. Older builds keep sending plain names.
- `itemCount` — products / services (inactive included) in the category.
- Apps group products and services by category in the categories' order; items without a category come last
  («Без категории»). (`GET /products` / `GET /services` keep their own sort order.)

### Product (jewelry, goods and consumables)
```json
{ "id": 1, "kind": "jewelry", "name": "Лабрет", "sku": "LB-12", "category": "Лабрет",
  "material": "Титан ASTM F136", "threadType": "internal", "thicknessMm": 1.2,
  "color": "Серебристый", "stone": "Фианит", "supplier": "Industrial Strength",
  "description": "...", "price": 1500, "cost": 600, "unit": "шт",
  "photos": ["/uploads/3f1c….jpg", "/uploads/9a0b….jpg"], "photoUrl": "/uploads/3f1c….jpg",
  "serviceIds": [3, 7], "stockMode": "quantity", "presenceStatus": null, "active": true, "archived": false,
  "variants": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "6 мм", "sku": null, "price": null, "cost": null,
      "quantity": 4, "minQuantity": 1, "lowStock": false },
    { "id": 5, "name": "8 мм", "sku": "LB-12-08", "price": 1700, "cost": 700,
      "quantity": 0, "minQuantity": 1, "lowStock": true } ],
  "quantity": 4, "minQuantity": 2, "lowStock": true, "size": "6 мм, 8 мм",
  "createdAt": "...", "updatedAt": "..." }
```
- `kind`: `jewelry` (sold to clients, visible to the bot) | `goods` (other things sold at the POS: aftercare sprays,
  gift cards…; sizes allowed, listed by the bot as «Товары») | `consumable` (used in procedures, not sold).
- `stockMode` (consumables only, else always `quantity`): `quantity` — counted in units like everything else;
  `presence` — only «есть / заканчивается / нет» is tracked (`presenceStatus`: `ok` | `low` | `out`, `null` in
  `quantity` mode). Presence consumables take no quantity movements (`400`); staff mark the status in the card or during
  a stock count, and record each restock with what it cost (`POST /products/:id/purchases`), so the analytics counts
  their expense. `lowStock` of a presence consumable = `presenceStatus != "ok"`.
- `archived` — deleted by staff but kept for its history (`DELETE /products/:id`): never listed, only fetched by id.
- `variants` — the sizes of the product (always at least one), in the order staff arranged them. Stock lives on
  variants: every receipt, sale, write-off, usage, count and return moves one variant.
  - A product without sizes has a single variant with `name: ""`. With two or more variants every `name` is required
    and unique within the product (case-insensitive). Consumables always have exactly one variant.
  - `sku`, `price`, `cost` — the size's own values; `null` = the product's. Selling price of a size =
    `variant.price ?? product.price`, cost = `variant.cost ?? product.cost`, article = `variant.sku ?? product.sku`.
  - `quantity` is maintained only through stock movements; `lowStock` (derived): `quantity <= minQuantity`.
  - Sizes removed in the editor disappear from `variants`; one with stock history is kept on the server (archived),
    so movements and sales still name it.
- Product-level `quantity` (Σ variants), `minQuantity` (Σ variants), `lowStock` (at least one variant is low) and
  `size` (variant names joined with `", "`, `null` when no variant has a name) are derived, output only, and keep
  older app builds working. Apps read `variants`.
- Jewelry attributes (all optional, `null` when not set):
  - `material` — free text; apps offer «Титан ASTM F136», «Титан ASTM F1295», «Хирургическая сталь 316L»,
    «Сталь ASTM F138», «Золото 585», «Золото 750», «Ниобий», «Биопласт (PTFE)», «Стекло».
  - `threadType`: `internal` (внутренняя резьба) | `external` (внешняя) | `threadless` (безрезьбовое, push-pin).
  - `thicknessMm` — bar / wire thickness in millimetres (`0 < x ≤ 30`, up to two decimals). Apps add the gauge:
    0.8 = 20G, 1.0 = 18G, 1.2 = 16G, 1.6 = 14G, 2.0 = 12G, 2.5 = 10G, 3.2 = 8G, 4.0 = 6G, 5.0 = 4G, 6.0 = 2G, 8.0 = 0G.
  - `color` (metal / anodizing colour), `stone` (insert: «Фианит», «Опал», …), `supplier` — free text up to 100 chars.
  - `serviceIds` — catalog services (piercing zones) the jewelry suits, e.g. «Хеликс», «Септум»; `[]` when none.
    The bot names them when it lists the jewelry.
- `photos`: up to 10 upload paths (`/uploads/…`), the first is the cover; `photoUrl` (derived) = `photos[0]` ?? `null`
  — shown in the POS catalog, the stock list and sent by the bot. Paths are relative to the server origin.
- Apps show markup = `price − cost` (and its share of `cost` in %), per size when the size has its own price or cost.

### StockMovement
```json
{ "id": 1, "productId": 1, "productName": "Лабрет", "variantId": 5, "variantName": "8 мм",
  "delta": -1, "quantityAfter": 11,
  "type": "sale", "note": null, "saleId": 5, "appointmentId": null, "revisionId": null, "amount": null,
  "employee": { "id": 1, "name": "Анна", "color": "#FF7A1A" }, "createdAt": "..." }
```
`type`: `receipt` (приход) | `sale` | `return` | `writeoff` (списание) | `usage` (расход на процедуру) | `adjustment` (инвентаризация)
| `purchase` (покупка расходника «есть / нет»: `delta` 0, `quantityAfter` 0, `amount` — what it cost).
`amount` — rubles paid: on `purchase`, and on a `receipt` recorded with `unitCost` (`unitCost × quantity`); `null`
otherwise.
`variantName` — the size's current name (`""` for a product without sizes); `quantityAfter` — the stock of that size
after the movement. `revisionId` — the stock count (`StockRevision`) an `adjustment` came from, else `null`.

### StockRevision (ревизия)
```json
{ "id": 3, "number": 3, "section": "consumable", "note": "Конец месяца",
  "employee": { EmployeeRef }, "counted": 24, "changed": 3,
  "surplus": 2, "shortage": 5, "surplusCost": 80, "shortageCost": 1200,
  "presenceChanges": [ { "productId": 15, "productName": "Антисептик", "from": "ok", "to": "low" } ],
  "movements": [ StockMovement ], "createdAt": "..." }
```
One stock count: what was counted and what differed. `counted` — sizes counted plus presence consumables marked;
`changed` — of them, those that differed; `surplus` / `shortage` — units found above / below the expected stock
(`…Cost` — the same at `variant.cost ?? product.cost`, unknown costs count as 0). `movements` — its `adjustment`
movements (only in `GET /stock/revisions/:id` and the `POST` response; `[]` in lists). `section` — the section counted
or `null` for a mixed count.

### Appointment
```json
{ "id": 1, "client": { ClientRef }, "master": { EmployeeRef }, "service": { ServiceRef } | null,
  "services": [ { "id": 10, "serviceId": 3, "name": "Соски — Два", "category": "piercing",
                  "price": 4000, "durationMin": 60 },
                { "id": 11, "serviceId": null, "name": "Подбор украшения", "category": null,
                  "price": 0, "durationMin": null } ],
  "title": "Тату на предплечье, эскиз согласован", "startsAt": "...", "endsAt": "...",
  "status": "scheduled", "price": 8000, "notes": "...",
  "deposit": 2000, "depositRequired": 2000, "depositStatus": "paid",
  "depositOperations": [ DepositOperation ], "depositLink": QrPayment | null,
  "saleId": null, "receiptId": null, "completedAt": null, "createdAt": "...", "updatedAt": "...",
  "cancellation": { "freeUntil": "...", "lateRetain": 2000, "noShowRetain": 2000 },
  "channel": "web", "onlineState": "awaiting_confirmation", "holdUntil": null }
```
`channel` — where it was booked: `app` (staff) | `bot` (the AI in Telegram) | `miniapp` (the Telegram Mini App) |
`web` (the booking page). `onlineState` — an online booking not settled yet: `awaiting_payment` (the time is held until
`holdUntil` while the client pays the prepayment by QR) | `awaiting_confirmation` (staff confirm or reject it) | `null`
(settled, or made by staff). Its `status` stays `scheduled` and it occupies its time like any appointment (see
«Online booking»).
`cancellation` — what the studio's rules (`StudioSettings.cancellation`) mean for this appointment while it has a
prepayment (held, else required); `null` when neither. `freeUntil` — the last moment a free cancellation is possible
(`null` when `freeHours` is 0); `lateRetain` / `noShowRetain` — rubles kept after a later cancellation / a no-show,
from the held prepayment (or the required one while nothing is held yet). They are counted from what is held now, so
after a partial retain they describe the remainder.
`status`: `scheduled` | `confirmed` | `completed` | `cancelled` | `no_show`. `saleId` — the sale that paid for it.
`receiptId` — its open receipt in the POS (`OpenReceipt`, the visit has started), `null` when none.
Visits carried over from YCLIENTS were paid in cash at the studio: the server maintenance script
`pay-imported-appointments --before=<the day MIKAN started>` (dry run by default; `--apply`) records each unpaid
scheduled / confirmed / completed visit that started before that day as a completed cash sale dated at the end of the
visit (note «Перенесено из YCLIENTS», no cash shift) — one item per booked service line, or one item at the visit
price — and completes the visit. Cancelled visits and no-shows are left as they are.
- Prepayment (see «Prepayments» below):
  - `depositRequired` — prepayment the studio asks for (defaults to the services' `depositAmount`; editable).
  - `deposit` — prepayment **held** for this appointment right now: received − applied in sales + returned by sale
    refunds − refunded to the client − retained. (Older builds read it as «prepayment received».)
  - `depositStatus`: `none` (nothing required or nothing to wait for) | `waiting` (required, nothing received yet,
    appointment `scheduled`/`confirmed`) | `paid` (`deposit > 0`; may be less than required) | `applied` (counted in a
    sale) | `refunded` (returned to the client) | `retained` (kept by the studio after a cancellation / no-show).
    Precedence: `paid` → `applied` → `retained` → `refunded` → `waiting`/`none`.
  - `depositOperations` — the prepayment ledger of this appointment, oldest first (`[]` when none).
  - `depositLink` — the latest SBP QR code issued for this appointment's prepayment (any status), or `null`.
- `services` — the booked service lines in order (`[]` when none). `name`/`price`/`durationMin` are snapshots taken
  at booking; `serviceId` is `null` for a custom line or a deleted catalog service; `category` comes from the
  linked catalog service (`null` otherwise).
- `service` — legacy single-service field kept for older app builds: the catalog service of the first line that
  has one (`null` otherwise).
- `title` — free-form description (sketch, zone, jewelry). Apps show service names first and fall back to `title`.
- `price` — the appointment total; equals the sum of line prices unless set explicitly.

### Sale
```json
{ "id": 1, "number": 17, "client": { ClientRef } | null, "employee": { EmployeeRef },
  "appointmentId": null, "shiftId": 3,
  "items": [ { "id": 1, "type": "product", "productId": 1, "variantId": 5, "variantName": "8 мм",
               "serviceId": null, "certificateId": null, "certificateCode": null, "name": "Лабрет — 8 мм", "quantity": 1,
               "price": 1500, "total": 1500 } ],
  "subtotal": 1500, "discount": 0, "total": 1500,
  "payments": { "cash": 1500, "card": 0, "transfer": 0, "qr": 0, "deposit": 0, "bonus": 0, "certificate": 0 },
  "bonusEarned": 75,
  "status": "completed", "note": null, "refundedAt": null, "refundReason": null, "createdAt": "..." }
```
- `type`: `product` (requires `productId`; decrements the stock of the sold size) | `service` (`serviceId` optional;
  `name` required when no `serviceId`).
- Product items: `variantId` — the size sold; `variantName` — its name at the moment of sale (`null` for services,
  for a product without sizes and for items sold before sizes existed); `name` = `"<product> — <size>"` (just the
  product name without a size), so receipts and history always show the size.
- `number`: sequential human-readable receipt number.
- `status`: `completed` | `refunded`.
- `payments.qr` — paid by an SBP QR code (Tochka); only set on sales created from a confirmed `QrPayment`.
- `payments.deposit` — part of the total covered by the appointment's prepayment (money received earlier and
  already counted when received, so it is not cash in the drawer now).
- `payments.bonus` — paid with the client's loyalty bonuses; `payments.certificate` — paid with gift certificates.
  `cash + card + transfer + qr + deposit + bonus + certificate = total`. `bonusEarned` — bonuses credited for this sale
  (0 when none; taken back on refund — a refunded sale still shows what it had credited).
- A gift certificate sold in the sale is a line with `certificateId` set. In responses it has `type: "service"`,
  `serviceId: null`, `name: "Подарочный сертификат MIKAN-7K3Q-9F2D"` (older builds know only `product` | `service`);
  apps treat any line with `certificateId` as a certificate; `certificateCode` carries its code (no need to read it
  from the name). Every line has `certificateId` and `certificateCode` (`null` for the others).

### OpenReceipt (открытый чек)
```json
{ "id": 7, "appointment": Appointment | null, "client": { ClientRef } | null,
  "items": [ { "type": "product", "productId": 1, "variantId": 5, "variantName": "8 мм", "productKind": "jewelry",
               "serviceId": null, "name": "Лабрет — 8 мм", "quantity": 1, "price": 1500, "total": 1500, "stock": 3 },
             { "type": "service", "productId": null, "variantId": null, "variantName": null, "productKind": null,
               "serviceId": 3, "name": "Прокол мочки", "quantity": 1, "price": 2500, "total": 2500, "stock": null,
               "certificate": null } ],
  "subtotal": 4000, "discount": 0, "total": 4000, "itemCount": 2, "note": null,
  "openedBy": { EmployeeRef }, "createdAt": "...", "updatedAt": "..." }
```
- A receipt being put together before payment. Nothing is sold yet: no stock moves, a prepayment stays held. Several
  receipts can be open at once (one per visit in progress plus receipts without an appointment), and every device sees
  the same list. An appointment has at most one open receipt.
- `items` — the lines in order, as the app saved them. Product lines: `name` = `"<product> — <size>"` from the current
  catalog (the saved name when the product is gone), `variantName` — the size's name (`null` without sizes),
  `productKind` — `jewelry` | `goods`, `stock` — the size's current quantity (`null` when the size is gone).
  Service lines: `name` as saved, `productKind`/`stock` `null`. `price` — the unit price saved for the line.
  A gift certificate to sell goes out like a sale's certificate line — `type: "service"`, `serviceId: null`,
  `name: "Подарочный сертификат"` — with `certificate: { "recipientName": "Маше", "note": null }`; every other line
  has `certificate: null`. Nothing is issued until the sale (no code yet). Older builds see an ordinary service line
  and would save it back as one.
- `subtotal = Σ quantity × price`, `total = subtotal − discount`, `itemCount = Σ quantity`.
- `appointment` — the whole appointment it pays for (status, held prepayment), `null` without one.
- `openedBy` — the employee who opened it.

### DepositOperation (prepayment ledger entry)
```json
{ "id": 7, "appointmentId": 4, "type": "receive", "amount": 2000, "method": "transfer",
  "saleId": null, "shiftId": 3, "qrPaymentId": null, "note": null,
  "employee": { EmployeeRef } | null, "createdAt": "..." }
```
- `type`: `receive` (money taken from the client) | `apply` (counted in sale `saleId`) | `unapply` (sale `saleId` was
  refunded: its prepayment part is held for the appointment again) | `refund` (returned to the client) |
  `retain` (kept by the studio after a cancellation / no-show).
- `method`: `cash` | `card` | `transfer` | `qr` for `receive` and `refund`; `null` otherwise.
- `shiftId`: the cash shift open at that moment (`null` when none). A `cash` receive / refund always has one.
- `qrPaymentId`: the SBP QR code a `receive` came from. `employee`: who recorded it (`null` for migrated entries;
  for a QR receive — who issued the code). `note`: comment / reason.

### QrPayment
```json
{ "id": 5, "kind": "sale", "appointmentId": null, "status": "pending", "amount": 3000,
  "payload": "https://qr.nspk.ru/AD10001B38T99KA99CD8S37FMTH8CFQ7?type=02&bank=100000000065&sum=300000&cur=RUB&crc=43B6",
  "expiresAt": "...", "sentAt": null, "error": null, "sale": null, "createdAt": "..." }
```
- `kind`: `sale` (QR part of a checkout; the server sells the cart when paid) | `deposit` (an appointment's
  prepayment; when paid the server records a `receive` with `method: "qr"`, no sale). `appointmentId` — the
  appointment of a `deposit` code (`null` for `sale`).
- `sentAt` — when the bot last sent this code's link to the client in Telegram (`deposit` only), else `null`.
- `payload` — the link to encode into the QR image (opens the client's bank app).
- `status`: `pending` → `paid` | `expired`; `pending` → `cancelled` (→ `paid` without `sale` if the client pays it anyway).
- `sale` — the `Sale` the server created once the bank confirmed the payment; `null` until then.
- `error` — while `pending`: a declined attempt (the client may retry the same code) or «bank unreachable, still
  checking»; when `paid` without `sale`: why the cart was not sold (paid after cancel, stock ran out, appointment already
  paid…) — staff finish the sale by hand (the app moves the QR share to «Перевод») or refund in the bank. Such payments
  are also sent to the staff Telegram chat.

### CashShift
```json
{ "id": 3, "openedAt": "...", "openedBy": { EmployeeRef }, "openingCash": 5000,
  "closedAt": null, "closedBy": null, "closingCash": null, "note": null,
  "expectedCash": 8500, "difference": null,
  "summary": { "salesCount": 3, "revenue": 10000, "cash": 2500, "card": 5000, "transfer": 0, "qr": 0, "deposit": 2500,
               "refunds": 0, "cashRefunds": 0, "cashIn": 0, "cashOut": 0,
               "deposits": { "received": 3000, "cash": 1000, "card": 0, "transfer": 2000, "qr": 0,
                             "refunded": 0, "cashRefunded": 0, "retained": 0 } },
  "operations": [ CashOperation ] }
```
- Sales part: `revenue` = money of the shift's sales = `cash + card + transfer + qr + deposit` (`deposit` — the part
  covered by prepayments received earlier): bonus and gift certificate payments are not money and stay out of it (a
  certificate sold is money in). `refunds` — the same money of the sales refunded in the shift.
- `deposits` — prepayment operations recorded while the shift was open: `received` (all methods) with its split by
  method, `refunded` (all methods) and `cashRefunded`, `retained`.
- `expectedCash = openingCash + summary.cash − summary.cashRefunds + summary.deposits.cash − summary.deposits.cashRefunded
  + summary.cashIn − summary.cashOut` (computed live while open; frozen at close).
- `difference = closingCash − expectedCash` after close.
- `operations` is included in `GET /cash/shift/current` and `GET /cash/shifts/:id`, empty array in lists.
- At most one shift is open at a time. Sales attach to the open shift if there is one (a shift is not required to sell).

### CashOperation
```json
{ "id": 1, "shiftId": 3, "type": "out", "amount": 1000, "reason": "Инкассация",
  "employee": { EmployeeRef }, "createdAt": "..." }
```
`type`: `in` (внесение) | `out` (изъятие). Requires an open shift.

### BotChat
```json
{ "chatId": 123456789, "client": { ClientRef } | null, "employee": { EmployeeRef } | null,
  "telegramName": "Иван", "username": "ivanp",
  "aiPaused": false, "needsAttention": false, "unreadCount": 2,
  "lastMessage": { BotMessage } | null, "updatedAt": "..." }
```
- `needsAttention` — the bot handed the conversation to staff (cleared when staff replies or marks read).
- `employee` — the studio employee recognised in this chat by the phone number they shared with the bot, or bound to
  it by staff in the app (`PUT /bot/chats/:chatId/employee`; see «Staff chats» in the Bot section): the bot answers
  this chat in staff mode. Only an **active** employee is shown — a deactivated one is `null` and loses staff mode at
  once (it comes back if the employee is reactivated, until staff unlink it). `null` for client chats. Apps mark such
  chats «Сотрудник: Анна»; `DELETE /bot/chats/:chatId/employee` unlinks (`204`).

### BotMessage
```json
{ "id": 1, "chatId": 123456789, "role": "user", "text": "Сколько стоит прокол хеликса?",
  "employee": { EmployeeRef } | null, "createdAt": "..." }
```
`role`: `user` (client) | `assistant` (AI) | `staff` (sent from the app by an employee) | `system` (automatic: aftercare, reminders, campaigns, birthday and win-back messages).

### ScheduledMessage
```json
{ "id": 1, "chatId": 123456789, "client": { ClientRef }, "appointmentId": 4,
  "kind": "aftercare", "sendAt": "...", "text": "...",
  "status": "pending", "sentAt": null, "error": null }
```
`kind`: `aftercare` | `reminder` | `healing_check` | `jewelry_change` | `reschedule_notice`. `status`: `pending` | `sent` | `failed` | `cancelled`.
An appointment has one `reminder` per `BotSettings.reminderOffsets` entry whose moment is still in the future. A
reminder sent on the day of the visit is headed «⏰ Сегодня ждём вас…», an earlier one «🗓 Напоминаем о записи…»; both
carry the inline buttons «✅ Приду» and «🔁 Перенести» (see «Reminder buttons» in the Bot section).

### BookingRequest (created by the bot)
```json
{ "id": 1, "chatId": 123456789, "client": { ClientRef } | null, "contactName": "Иван",
  "phone": "+79991234567", "serviceName": "Прокол хеликса", "preferredTime": "в субботу после 15:00",
  "comment": "...", "status": "new", "createdAt": "...", "updatedAt": "..." }
```
`status`: `new` | `processed` | `rejected`.

### KnowledgeEntry (bot knowledge base)
```json
{ "id": 1, "title": "Противопоказания", "content": "...", "active": true, "sort": 0, "updatedAt": "..." }
```

### StudioSettings
```json
{ "name": "MIKAN STUDIO", "address": "", "phone": "", "workingHours": "Ежедневно 11:00–21:00",
  "instagram": "", "website": "", "about": "", "timezone": "Europe/Moscow",
  "workdayStart": "10:00", "workdayEnd": "21:00",
  "cancellation": { "freeHours": 24, "lateRetainPercent": 100, "noShowRetainPercent": 100, "autoRetain": false },
  "reviewLinks": { "yandex": "https://yandex.ru/maps/org/…", "twogis": "", "google": "" },
  "onlineBooking": { "enabled": true, "leadMinutes": 120, "horizonDays": 60, "holdMinutes": 15, "stepMinutes": 30,
                     "note": "", "confirmationHours": 24 } }
```
- `onlineBooking` — the client-facing booking (bot, Mini App, booking page; see «Online booking»): `enabled` (default
  `true`; `false` → the booking page says «Онлайн-запись временно недоступна» and the bot falls back to booking
  requests); `leadMinutes` (0…2880, default 120) — the earliest start from now; `horizonDays` (1…180, default 60) — how
  far ahead; `holdMinutes` (5…60, default 15) — time to pay the prepayment; `stepMinutes` (15 | 30 | 60, default 30) —
  the grid of offered starts from the beginning of the master's working day; `note` (≤ 500) — shown to clients on the
  booking page («Возьмите с собой паспорт»); `confirmationHours` (1…168 or `null` = never, default 24) — an online
  booking still `awaiting_confirmation` that long after it was made, or 2 hours before its start if that comes first,
  is rejected by itself with the reason «Студия не успела подтвердить запись — выберите, пожалуйста, другое время»
  (the client is told with the booking link, staff see it in the staff chat; audited as `system`; checked every
  minute). On PUT omitted = unchanged.
- `cancellation` — the studio's prepayment rules, told to clients and applied when a visit that holds a prepayment is
  cancelled or missed:
  - `freeHours` (0…336) — a cancellation at least this many hours before the start is free (the whole prepayment can
    be refunded); `0` = never free. `lateRetainPercent` / `noShowRetainPercent` (0…100) — the share of the held
    prepayment the studio keeps after a later cancellation / a no-show. Defaults 24 / 100 / 100.
  - `autoRetain` (default `false`) — when the appointment becomes `cancelled` late or `no_show`, the server itself
    records the `retain` of that share (reason «Поздняя отмена — меньше 24 ч до записи» / «Неявка»); any remainder
    stays held for staff to refund. With `false` nothing happens by itself and the app proposes the amount.
  - On PUT omitted = unchanged (older builds never send it); each field is validated, an invalid one → `400`.
- `reviewLinks` — where clients leave a review (`https://…`, ≤ 500 characters each; `""` = none): the bot offers them
  after a healing check-in. On PUT omitted = unchanged.
- `workdayStart` / `workdayEnd` — working hours «с» / «до», `"HH:MM"` in the studio `timezone` (`"24:00"` = midnight;
  the end must be later than the start). The app's calendar (day / 3 days / week) starts and ends at these hours.
  They are **not** a booking limit: staff may book or move appointments to any time, the server accepts them, and
  the calendar widens its range to show appointments outside the hours. Defaults `11:00`–`21:00`; settings saved
  before these fields existed take them from the first `HH:MM–HH:MM` range in `workingHours`.
- `workingHours` — free text for clients (the bot quotes it); when empty, the bot names `workdayStart`–`workdayEnd`.

### BotSettings
```json
{ "enabled": true, "aiEnabled": true, "greeting": "...", "extraInstructions": "",
  "aftercareHour": 12, "remindersEnabled": true, "reminderOffsets": [1440, 120], "reminderHoursBefore": 24,
  "morningDigestAt": "09:30", "eveningDigestAt": "21:30",
  "botUsername": "mikan_studio_bot", "staffChatBound": false, "aiConfigured": true }
```
- `morningDigestAt` / `eveningDigestAt` — when the bot sends the morning summary («что на сегодня») and the evening
  summary («итоги дня») to every staff chat, `"HH:MM"` in the studio timezone; `null` = that summary is off. Defaults
  `"09:30"` and `"21:30"`. On PUT: omitted = unchanged, `null` = off (older builds never send them). See «Staff digests».
- `botUsername`, `staffChatBound`, `aiConfigured` are read-only (ignored on PUT).
- `reminderOffsets` — when the bot reminds clients of an appointment: minutes before its start, e.g. `[1440, 120]` =
  «за 1 день» and «за 2 часа». 1–6 distinct integers, each 15…20160 (15 minutes … 14 days); the server returns them
  sorted descending (earliest reminder first). Default `[1440]`. Invalid lists → `400` («Напоминания»: …).
- `reminderHoursBefore` — kept for older builds: output = the first (largest) offset in whole hours, within 1…168. On
  PUT it is used only when `reminderOffsets` is absent and its value differs from the current output (older builds
  resend what they read), and then means a single reminder that many hours before (1–168). Settings saved before
  `reminderOffsets` existed read as `[reminderHoursBefore × 60]`.
- Changing `reminderOffsets` or `remindersEnabled` rebuilds the pending reminders of every upcoming scheduled /
  confirmed appointment (moments already in the past are skipped; reminders already sent stay sent).

## Endpoints

### Health & auth
| Method | Path | Body | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/health` | — | `{ "ok": true, "version": "1.0.0" }` |
| POST | `/auth/login` | `{ login, password }` | `{ token, employee: Employee }` · `401 unauthorized` on bad credentials · rate-limited (10/min per IP) |
| GET | `/auth/me` | — | `Employee` |

The token lives 90 days. On first start, if there are no employees, the server creates one from `ADMIN_LOGIN` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` / `ADMIN_NAME` env.

#### Sessions
Every login opens a session (one device) and the token carries its id (`sid`). A request with a token of an ended
session → `401` «Сессия завершена — войдите снова». Tokens issued before sessions existed (no `sid`) keep working
until they expire or the password changes. The app sends `X-Device: <model> · MIKAN <build>` on login (UTF-8; without
the header the session is named by the user agent; ≤ 200 characters).

| Method | Path | Body | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/auth/logout` | — | `204` — ends the current session (signing out of this phone only) |
| GET | `/auth/sessions` | — | `{ items: [Session] }` — the employee's own active sessions; the owner gets everyone's (`?employeeId=` filters) · most recently used first · someone else's `employeeId` for anyone but the owner → `403` |
| DELETE | `/auth/sessions/:id` | — | `204` — ends a session: your own, or anyone's for the owner (else `403` «Это доступно владельцу студии») · unknown → `404` · an ended one → `204`, unchanged |

`Session`: `{ id, employee: EmployeeRef, device, ip, createdAt, lastSeenAt, current: true }` (`current` — the session
of this request). `lastSeenAt` is updated at most once a minute. A password change or deactivation ends all of the
employee's sessions (as before). Sessions unused for 90 days end by themselves. Face ID is an app-only lock: after
the app was in the background for more than 5 minutes (or after a restart) it asks for Face ID / the passcode before
showing anything; on by default after the first sign-in, switchable in More → «Безопасность». «Выйти на всех
устройствах» there ends each of the employee's other sessions (`DELETE /auth/sessions/:id`), then signs out of this
one (`POST /auth/logout`); devices still on a token without `sid` stay signed in until the password changes.

### Badges & dashboard
| Method | Path | Response |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/badges` | `{ "unreadChats": 2, "needsAttention": 1, "newBookingRequests": 1, "lowStock": 3, "onlineAwaiting": 2, "waitlist": 4 }` (the app polls every 30 s; `lowStock` — active products with at least one low size; `onlineAwaiting` — online bookings in the future waiting for staff confirmation; `waitlist` — open waitlist entries, `waiting` or `notified`) |
| GET | `/dashboard` | `{ "date": "2026-10-15", "appointments": [Appointment] (today, studio tz, excl. cancelled), "revenueToday": 12000 (revenue as in analytics: without bonus payments and certificates sold), "salesCountToday": 4, "openShift": CashShift \| null, "badges": {…same as /badges} }` |

### Employees
| Method | Path | Body | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/employees?includeInactive=true` | — | `{ items: [Employee] }` (active only by default) |
| POST | `/employees` | `{ name, login, password (≥6), phone?, color?, isMaster, role? }` | `Employee` · owner · `409 conflict` if login taken |
| PATCH | `/employees/:id` | any of `{ name, login, password, phone, color, isMaster, role, active }` | `Employee` · owner; anyone for themselves: `name`, `phone`, `color`, `password` only · cannot deactivate yourself or change your own role (`400`) |

- A field sent with its current value counts as unchanged (the app sends the whole card): a master saving their own
  card with the same `login`, `isMaster`, `role` and `active: true` gets `200`; a changed one → `403` «Это доступно
  владельцу студии». Changing your own role → `400` «Нельзя изменить собственную роль»; deactivating yourself →
  `400` «Нельзя отключить собственную учётную запись».

### Work schedules
| Method | Path | Body | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/schedules?from=&to=` (studio dates, ≤ 62 days) | — | `{ items: [ScheduleDayOut] }` — every active master × every date |
| GET | `/employees/:id/schedule?from=` | — | `WorkSchedule` |
| PUT | `/employees/:id/schedule` | `{ weekly: [7 × entry \| null] \| null }` | `WorkSchedule` · owner, admin |
| PUT | `/employees/:id/schedule/days` | `{ from, to (≤ 62 days), off, start?, end?, breaks?, note? }` | `WorkSchedule` · sets every date in range · owner, admin |
| DELETE | `/employees/:id/schedule/days?from=&to=` | — | `WorkSchedule` · removes the exceptions in range · owner, admin |

- `to` defaults to `from` (a single date) on `PUT …/days` and `DELETE …/days`; both are inclusive. `off: true` ignores
  `start` / `end` / `breaks`; `note` ≤ 200 characters. A master writing → `403` «Это доступно владельцу и
  администратору». `WorkSchedule` from writes lists the exceptions from today on.
- `GET /schedules`: `from` and `to` required; items sorted by date, then masters by name (the masters are those the
  bot books with: active `isMaster` employees, every active employee when none is).

`ScheduleDayOut`: `{ "employeeId": 3, "date": "2026-10-21", "working": true, "start": "12:00", "end": "21:00",
"breaks": [ { "start": "15:00", "end": "15:30" } ], "source": "weekly", "note": null }` — `source`: `weekly` |
`day` (an exception) | `studio` (no own schedule); `working: false` → `start`/`end` `null`. Invalid times, a break
outside the hours, overlapping breaks, `end` ≤ `start` → `400` with the Russian reason.

### Payroll
| Method | Path | Body | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/payroll?from=&to=` (studio dates, ≤ 400 days) | — | `{ from, to, items: [PayrollStatement] }` — owner: every employee with rules or activity in the period; others: only themselves |
| GET | `/payroll/:employeeId?from=&to=` | — | `PayrollStatement` + `lines` + `adjustmentItems` · owner or themselves |
| GET | `/employees/:id/pay-rules` | — | `{ current: PayRules \| null, history: [ { effectiveFrom, rules: PayRules, createdBy: EmployeeRef \| null, createdAt } ] }` · owner or themselves |
| PUT | `/employees/:id/pay-rules` | `{ effectiveFrom? (default today), ...PayRules }` | same as GET · owner · the same `effectiveFrom` replaces that version |
| POST | `/payroll/adjustments` | `{ employeeId, date?, kind, amount, note?, fromCash? }` | `PayrollAdjustment` · owner · `fromCash: true` (advance / payout only) also records a cash withdrawal «Аванс: Фатима» in the open shift (`409` without one) · accepts `Idempotency-Key` |
| DELETE | `/payroll/adjustments/:id` | — | `204` · owner · its cash withdrawal, if any, stays (correct it in the till) |

`from` and `to` are required (`400` «Конец периода должен быть не раньше начала», «Период — не больше 400 дней»).
The owner's list has every employee (inactive ones included) with a rules version in force by `to` or with visits,
sales, attributed products or adjustments in the period, by name. `current` of the pay rules — the version in force
today (`null` before the first one). Anyone else asking for another employee → `403` «Это доступно владельцу студии».

### Audit log
| Method | Path | Response |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/audit?from=&to=&employeeId=&entity=&entityId=&source=&limit=&offset=` | `{ items: [AuditEntry], total }` newest first · owner |

`from` / `to` — instants (`to` exclusive); `entity` — one entity or a comma-separated list (`entity=appointment,deposit`:
an appointment with its prepayment); `limit` default 50, max 200. Anyone but the owner → `403` «Это доступно владельцу
студии».

- Logged: every successful write request from the app (`POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE`) except `POST /auth/login`,
  `POST /uploads`, `POST /bot/chats/:chatId/read`, `POST /bot/staff-code`, `POST /devices`, `DELETE /devices/:token`,
  `POST /campaigns/preview` and idempotent replays; online bookings from the booking page and the Mini App and client
  cancellations on the booking page and moves / cancellations in the client cabinet as `online`; client actions in the bot (online booking, booking request,
  reschedule, confirm «Приду», «🔕 Не присылать новости» / «Снова получать новости» — `client.marketing_opt_out` /
  `client.marketing_opt_in`) as `bot`; staff bot actions as `bot_staff`; automatic prepayment retain, bank-confirmed
  QR payments, an online hold confirmed by its prepayment and an unpaid hold released as `system`. Staff confirming / rejecting an online booking
  in the app is `appointment.online_confirm` / `appointment.online_reject`. Signing out is `employee.logout`
  («Выход из приложения на устройстве «iPhone 16 Pro · MIKAN 13»»), ending a session from the list
  `employee.session_end` («Сессия «Анна» на устройстве «…» завершена»), both with the id of the session's employee.
- `summary` is written for people, in Russian, impersonal (the employee's gender is not stored; the app shows who
  next to it): «Запись №1846 (Анна Иванова) перенесена с … на …», «Продажа №1580 возвращена: 3 500 ₽»,
  «Цена «Мочка»: 1 600 → 1 800 ₽», «Фатиме назначена роль «Мастер»». Entities: `appointment`, `deposit`, `sale`, `receipt`, `cash`, `client`,
  `service`, `product`, `stock`, `category`, `aftercare`, `knowledge`, `employee`, `schedule`, `payroll`,
  `settings`, `bot`, `campaign`, `certificate`, `waitlist`, `portfolio`. A manual bonus adjustment is `client.bonus_adjust` on the client
  («Начислено 500 бонусов клиенту «Анна Иванова»: Компенсация»); certificates log `certificate.update` /
  `certificate.cancel` / `certificate.send`; a sale paid with bonuses or certificates says so («… Оплачено бонусами
  300 ₽, сертификатом 1 000 ₽»). `action` is `<entity>.<verb>` (`appointment.move`, `sale.refund`, …).
- `entityId` is the id of what the entry is about: `deposit` — the appointment; `stock` — the product (`null` for a
  stock count); `cash` — the shift; `schedule` and `payroll` — the employee; `bot` — the chat id (may be negative),
  the booking request or the scheduled message; `sale` — the sale (`null` for a QR code not yet paid); `settings` and
  a category reorder — `null`. An edit that changed nothing is logged too («… сохранена без изменений»); a write
  without a specific summary gets «Изменение: PUT /…» with the entity taken from the path.
- Kept 2 years (older rows are pruned daily). A failure to write the log never fails the request (it is logged).
- The app shows the log to the owner (More → «Журнал действий», filters by employee and section) and, on an
  appointment, client, sale, product or gift certificate card, its own history (`?entity=&entityId=`).

### Clients
| Method | Path | Body | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/clients?search=&archived=false&limit=&offset=` | — | `{ items: [Client], total }` — search matches the full name (first and last name), phone digits, instagram, Telegram nick and bot username; sorted by full name |
| GET | `/clients/:id` | — | `Client` with `stats` and `loyalty` (so do `POST` / `PATCH`) |
| POST | `/clients` | `{ name, phone, lastName?, birthday?, telegramNick?, instagram?, notes?, source?, botEnabled?, marketingOptOut? }` | `Client` · `400` without `phone` («Телефон»: обязательное поле) · `409 conflict` if phone already belongs to another client (message names that client) |
| PATCH | `/clients/:id` | `{ name?, phone?, lastName?, birthday?, telegramNick?, instagram?, notes?, source?, botEnabled?, archived?, marketingOptOut? }` | `Client` · `400` when clearing a phone the client has |

- PATCH: omitted fields are kept, `null` / `""` clears an optional field. A phone, once set, can be changed but not
  removed. For a card without a phone, `phone: null` changes nothing, so older builds (which send every field, the
  empty phone as `null`) can still edit such cards.
| GET | `/clients/:id/history` | — | `{ items: [HistoryEntry], appointments: [Appointment], sales: [Sale] }` newest first (see History) |
| GET | `/clients/:id/chat` | — | `{ "chat": BotChat \| null }` — the client's Telegram bot chat (the linked chat, else the latest chat attributed to the client); `null` if the client has never written to the bot |
| POST | `/clients/:id/telegram-link` | — | `{ "url": "https://t.me/<bot>?start=c<token>" }` — opening it links the Telegram chat to this client |
| GET | `/clients/duplicates` | — | `{ items: [DuplicateGroup] }` — likely duplicate cards, strongest first · owner, admin |
| POST | `/clients/:id/merge` | `{ intoId }` | `Client` (the one kept) — merges card `:id` into `intoId` · owner, admin |

**Duplicates.** `DuplicateGroup`: `{ reason: "same_full_name" | "phoneless_same_name" | "same_telegram" |
"same_instagram", clients: [ Client with `stats` ] }`. Names compare case-insensitively, `ё` = `е`, spaces collapsed;
`same_full_name` needs a last name on both; `phoneless_same_name` — the same first (+ last when both have one) name
where one card has no phone; first-name-only matches between two cards with different phones are not offered. A pair
the staff dismissed is not offered again (`POST /clients/duplicates/dismiss { clientIds: [a, b] }` → `204`).
- The full name is the words of `name` + `lastName` (older cards hold it all in `name`): the first word is the first
  name, the rest the last name. `same_telegram` — the staff-typed `telegramNick` or the linked chat's
  `telegramUsername` of one card equals either of the other's (without `@`, any case); `same_instagram` — any case.
  Archived cards take part.
- Strongest first: `same_telegram`, `same_instagram`, `same_full_name`, `phoneless_same_name`. A group holds the cards
  joined by pairs of its reason (so a first-name group may hold cards with different last names, each matching the
  phoneless one); a group whose cards all sit in a stronger group is left out (a pair with the same Telegram and the
  same name shows once). Groups of a reason go by name; in a group the card with the most visits (then spent) comes
  first.
- Dismiss: `clientIds` — 2…500 distinct cards (a whole group may be sent); the pairs among them that would be offered
  are stored (settings key `clientDuplicatesDismissed`). An unknown card → `404`; fewer than two or repeated ids →
  `400`. Audited as `client.dismiss_duplicates` («Карточки №12 и №34 отмечены как разные люди»).

**Merge** `:id` (the source) into `intoId` (kept), in one transaction: every appointment, sale, open receipt, bot chat
attribution, bonus operation, certificate (as buyer), campaign recipient, retention send and audit reference of the
source moves to the kept card; the kept card's empty fields take the source's values (`phone`, `lastName`,
`birthday`, `telegramNick`, `instagram`, `source`; the Telegram link when the kept card has none), `notes` are joined;
then the source card is deleted. Both linked to different Telegram chats → the kept card keeps its own link, the
source's chat stays attributed to the kept card. The same card, an unknown card → `400` / `404`. Audited as
`client.merge` («Карточка «Анна» (+7 999…) объединена с «Анна Иванова»»).
- Also moved: scheduled messages, booking requests and the cart of an unpaid checkout QR code. Rows unique per client:
  of two campaign recipients of one campaign the one that got further stays (`sent` > `blocked` > `failed` >
  `skipped` > `pending`, so nobody gets a campaign twice); of two retention sends of the same kind and period the kept
  card's stays. The source's dismissed duplicate pairs go to the kept card.
- Fields: the source's last name is its `lastName`, or the words after the first name of an older card's `name`; it
  is not added when the kept card's `name` already holds it; a note contained in the other is not
  repeated (joined with an empty line) — joined notes longer than 5 000 characters → `400` «Заметки двух карточек
  вместе длиннее 5000 символов — сократите их и повторите» (nothing changes). `telegramUsername` follows the link;
  with neither card linked, a link sent to the source and not opened yet links the kept card. A «no news» request
  (`marketingOptOut`) of either card stays; the card is archived only when both were; `createdAt` is the earlier one;
  `name`, `botEnabled` are the kept card's. Reminders of the kept card's upcoming visits are rebuilt for its chat.

### Services
| Method | Path | Body | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/services?includeInactive=true` | — | `{ items: [Service] }` sorted by `sort`, then name |
| POST | `/services` | `{ name, category, group?, price, priceMax?, priceFrom?, durationMin, description?, imageUrl?, imagePrompt?, photos?, variants?, depositAmount?, aftercareTemplateId?, freshProcedure?, healingCheckDays?, jewelryChangeWeeks?, jewelryIds?, consumables?, active?, sort? }` | `Service` |
| PATCH | `/services/:id` | any of the above | `Service` |
| GET | `/services/:id/history?limit=&offset=` | — | `{ items: [HistoryEntry], total }` — who got this service and when, newest first |

- `jewelryIds` (≤ 100) replaces the compatible jewelry (`kind: jewelry` products, `400` «Украшение не найдено»
  otherwise); `consumables` (≤ 50, `{ productId, quantity: 1…1000 }`, distinct products) replaces the norm (`kind:
  consumable` products, `400` «Расходник не найден» otherwise). Omitted — unchanged.
| POST | `/services/:id/image/generate` | `{ prompt? }` (≤ 1000 chars) | `Service` with a new `imageUrl` — generates the schematic cover with AI (Polza Media API, ~1–2 min; apps use a 4-minute timeout). A non-empty `prompt` is used and saved as `imagePrompt`; `prompt: ""` / `null` resets it (generates from the name/description and saves `imagePrompt = null`); without `prompt` the saved `imagePrompt` (or name/description) is used. Only `imageUrl` (and `imagePrompt` when `prompt` is sent) change, so edits made during generation are kept. `409 conflict` when the AI key (`AI_API_KEY` + `AI_BASE_URL`) is not configured or a generation for this service is already running, `502 upstream_error` when generation fails (message says why). The previous picture file is kept. |

### Aftercare templates
| Method | Path | Body | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/aftercare-templates` | — | `{ items: [AftercareTemplate] }` |
| POST | `/aftercare-templates` | `{ name, category, steps: [{ dayOffset ≥ 0, text }] (≥1) }` | `AftercareTemplate` |
| PATCH | `/aftercare-templates/:id` | any of the above | `AftercareTemplate` |
| DELETE | `/aftercare-templates/:id` | — | `204` (services referencing it get `aftercareTemplateId = null`) |

### Catalog categories
| Method | Path | Body | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/catalog/categories?section=` | — | `{ items: [CatalogCategory] }` by section, service category, position |
| POST | `/catalog/categories` | `{ section, serviceCategory?, name }` | `CatalogCategory` (added at the end) · `409` «Категория «Лабрет» уже есть» |
| PATCH | `/catalog/categories/:id` | `{ name }` | `CatalogCategory` — renames it and every item in it · `409` when another category of the same section (and service category) has that name |
| PUT | `/catalog/categories/order` | `{ ids: [4, 2, 9] }` | `{ items: [CatalogCategory] }` — positions in this order; every id of one section (and service category), all of them listed (`400` otherwise) |
| POST | `/catalog/categories/:id/merge` | `{ intoId }` | `CatalogCategory` (the target) — moves the items into `intoId` (same section and service category) and deletes this one |
| DELETE | `/catalog/categories/:id` | — | `204` — the items stay, without a category |

`serviceCategory` is required for `section: "service"` and must be absent / `null` otherwise. Names: 1–100 chars.

### Products & stock
| Method | Path | Body | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/products?kind=jewelry&search=&lowStock=true&includeInactive=true` | — | `{ items: [Product] }` sorted by category, name |
| GET | `/products/:id` | — | `Product` |
| POST | `/products` | see below | `Product` |
| PATCH | `/products/:id` | any of the POST fields | `Product` |
| DELETE | `/products/:id?writeOff=true` | — | `{ "deleted": true }` or `{ "archived": true, "writtenOff": 3 }` · `409` while stock is left without `writeOff` |
| POST | `/products/:id/movements` | `{ type: "receipt"\|"writeoff"\|"usage"\|"adjustment", variantId?, quantity, unitCost?, note? }` | `{ product: Product, movement: StockMovement }` · accepts `Idempotency-Key` |
| POST | `/products/:id/movements/batch` | `{ type, note?, unitCost?, lines: [{ variantId, quantity, unitCost? }] }` | `{ product: Product, movements: [StockMovement] }` · accepts `Idempotency-Key` |
| POST | `/products/:id/purchases` | `{ amount, note?, presenceStatus? }` | `{ product: Product, movement: StockMovement }` · accepts `Idempotency-Key` |
| GET | `/products/:id/movements?variantId=&limit=&offset=` | — | `{ items: [StockMovement], total }` |
| GET | `/products/:id/history?variantId=&limit=&offset=` | — | `{ items: [HistoryEntry], total }` — who bought this product (or this size) and when, newest first |
| GET | `/stock/movements?type=&limit=&offset=` | — | `{ items: [StockMovement], total }` newest first |

- `search` matches the name, SKUs (product and sizes), category, material, colour, stone, supplier and size names.
  `lowStock=true` — products with at least one low size (presence consumables: status not `ok`).
- `POST/PATCH /products` also take `stockMode` and `presenceStatus` (consumables only; `400` for other kinds).
  Switching a consumable to `presence` keeps its counted stock aside (shown nowhere) and starts `ok` when it had
  stock, `out` otherwise; switching back to `quantity` uses the counted stock again.
- `goods` follow the rules of `jewelry` for sizes, sales and stock; only consumables are limited to one size.

`POST /products` body:
```json
{ "kind": "jewelry", "name": "Лабрет", "sku": "LB-12", "category": "Лабрет",
  "material": "Титан ASTM F136", "threadType": "internal", "thicknessMm": 1.2, "color": null, "stone": null,
  "supplier": "Industrial Strength", "description": null, "price": 1500, "cost": 600, "unit": "шт",
  "photos": ["/uploads/3f1c….jpg"], "serviceIds": [3], "active": true,
  "variants": [ { "name": "6 мм", "minQuantity": 1, "initialQuantity": 4 },
                { "name": "8 мм", "sku": "LB-12-08", "price": 1700, "cost": 700, "minQuantity": 1, "initialQuantity": 0 } ] }
```
- `variants` (1–50): `{ id?, name?, sku?, price?, cost?, minQuantity?, initialQuantity? }`. A new size with
  `initialQuantity > 0` gets a `receipt` movement «Начальный остаток».
- PATCH with `variants` replaces the list (the new order is kept): an item with `id` (a size of this product) updates
  that size (`initialQuantity` is ignored), an item without `id` adds a size, and a size left out is removed — deleted
  when it has no movements or sales, archived otherwise. A size added without `id` under the name of an archived size
  of the product brings that size back (same `id`, its history kept). Removing a size that still has stock → `409 conflict`
  («Размер «8 мм»: на складе 3 шт — спишите остаток, прежде чем удалять размер»); an unknown `id` → `400`.
- Validation (`400`): a duplicate size name, an empty name when there are two or more sizes, more than one size for a
  consumable.
- Without `variants` (older builds) the legacy fields `size`, `minQuantity` and `initialQuantity` (POST only) describe
  the only size. On PATCH they change the only size; when the product has several sizes, a changed `size` or
  `minQuantity` → `409 conflict` «У «Лабрет» несколько размеров — обновите приложение MIKAN, чтобы изменить их»
  (unchanged values, which older builds always resend, are ignored).
- `photos` (≤ 10) replaces the photos; without it, `photoUrl` (older builds) replaces the cover (`null` removes it)
  and keeps the other photos.
- `serviceIds` (≤ 30) replaces the linked services; an unknown id → `400`.
- `quantity` is never set by PATCH.
- `DELETE` removes a product from the warehouse. One with no stock movements and no sold items is deleted for good
  (its sizes, links to services and consumption norms go with it): `{ "deleted": true }`. One with history is
  **archived** — hidden from every list, the POS, the bot, stock counts and the low-stock badge, but sales, history
  and movements still name it: `{ "archived": true, "writtenOff": 0 }`; its links to services and consumption norms are
  removed, and it can no longer be sold or moved (`400` «Позиция удалена со склада»). Stock left on it → `409 conflict`
  «На складе ещё 3 шт. — спишите остаток, чтобы удалить позицию» unless `?writeOff=true`, which first writes the
  stock of every size off (a presence consumable has no stock to write off: it is deleted as is) (`writeoff` movements, note «Позиция удалена со склада»; counted as a stock expense) and
  returns `writtenOff` = the units written off. Deleting twice → `404`.

Movements:
- `quantity` semantics: `receipt` — positive amount added; `writeoff`/`usage` — positive amount removed;
  `adjustment` — the **new absolute quantity** of the size after a stock count (server computes `delta`). Stock may not
  go below 0 (`409 insufficient_stock`, «Недостаточно на складе: Лабрет — 8 мм (осталось 2)»).
- `variantId` must be a current size of the product (`400` otherwise). Without it (older builds) the only size is
  used; for a product with several sizes → `409 conflict` «У «Лабрет» несколько размеров — обновите приложение MIKAN,
  чтобы провести операцию по размеру».
- `unitCost` (receipts only; ignored for other types) — what one unit cost on this delivery (0…100 000 000 ₽). The
  movement keeps `amount = unitCost × quantity`, and the cost becomes the new cost of what was received: the size's
  own `cost` when it has one, else the product's `cost` (so valuations and margins use the latest price). In `batch`
  a line's `unitCost` wins over the body's. Without `unitCost` a receipt's `amount` is `null` and costs do not change.
- `batch` records one operation for several sizes in one transaction (a delivery, a stock count of all sizes):
  1–50 lines with distinct `variantId`s. `receipt` / `writeoff` / `usage` lines need `quantity > 0`; `adjustment`
  lines whose count equals the current stock are skipped, and a count that changes nothing → `400` «Остатки не
  изменились». `movements` are in line order.
- `purchases` — a restock of a **presence** consumable (gloves, wipes…) with what it cost: `amount` 1…100 000 000 ₽
  (required), `note` (supplier, how many packs), `presenceStatus` after it (default `ok`). Writes a `purchase`
  movement (`delta` 0, `amount`) and sets the status. Other products → `400` «Сумму покупки записывают для расходников
  «есть / нет». Для остальных — приход количеством.». The analytics counts the amount as a stock expense of the day
  of the purchase (`stock.purchases`).

Stock counts (ревизии):
| Method | Path | Body | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/stock/revisions` | `{ section?, note?, counts: [{ variantId, quantity }], presence: [{ productId, status }] }` | `StockRevision` · accepts `Idempotency-Key` |
| GET | `/stock/revisions?limit=&offset=` | — | `{ items: [StockRevision], total }` newest first (`movements: []`) |
| GET | `/stock/revisions/:id` | — | `StockRevision` with `movements` |

- `counts` (≤ 2 000, distinct sizes of quantity-mode products): the counted stock of each size; a differing one gets an
  `adjustment` movement «Ревизия №N» (+ note). `presence` (≤ 500, presence consumables): the marked status.
- At least one line (`400` «Ревизия пустая»); a count that matches everything is still recorded (`changed: 0`) —
  it documents that the stock was checked. One transaction; `number` is sequential.

### Uploads
| Method | Path | Body | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/uploads` | `multipart/form-data`, field `file` (JPEG/PNG/HEIC/WebP, ≤ 10 MB) | `{ "url": "/uploads/<uuid>.<ext>" }` |

Files are served publicly at `GET /uploads/<name>` (outside `/api`, no auth; names are unguessable UUIDs).

### Appointments
| Method | Path | Body | Response |

- `services`: `[{ serviceId?, name?, price?, durationMin? }]` (≤ 20) — replaces all service lines (`[]` clears them).
  A line with `serviceId` defaults `name`, `price` and `durationMin` from the catalog service; a line without one
  needs `name` (`price` defaults to 0). Apps resolve variants themselves and send the variant's name/price/duration.
- Legacy `serviceId` (older builds) is used only when `services` is absent: the same service as the current first
  catalog line keeps the lines untouched (`null` included — older builds always send `null` for appointments whose
  lines are all custom); another service replaces them with that single service; `null` while the appointment has a
  catalog service clears them.
- `price` defaults to the sum of line prices (on create, and on PATCH when `services` is sent without `price`).
- `depositRequired` defaults the same way to the sum of the lines' catalog `depositAmount`. The legacy input field
  `deposit` (older builds) is ignored: prepayments change only through the prepayment endpoints below.
- Moving an appointment to `cancelled` / `no_show` / `completed` (and paying it at checkout) cancels its pending
  prepayment QR codes; a prepayment it holds stays held until staff refund or retain it (or apply it at checkout).
- `endsAt` defaults (create only) to `startsAt` + the sum of line durations; it must be after `startsAt`.
- Overlap check: if the master already has a non-cancelled, non-no-show appointment overlapping the time, respond
  `409 schedule_conflict` (message names the conflicting client and time) unless `force: true`.
- The studio's working hours (`StudioSettings.workdayStart` / `workdayEnd`) do not restrict `startsAt` / `endsAt`:
  appointments before opening or after closing are accepted. A master's own work schedule does (see
  «WorkSchedule»): outside it → `409 schedule_conflict` unless `force: true`.
- A master may create and change only their own appointments (see «Roles»); completing is open to every role.
- `notifyClient: true` on a PATCH that changes `startsAt` (a move: drag in the calendar or the edit form): when the
  client has Telegram linked and `botEnabled`, the server queues a `reschedule_notice` scheduled message sent at once
  (the sender delivers it within 30 s, with retries) with the «✅ Приду» / «🔁 Перенести» buttons:
  «Анна, ваша запись перенесена 🗓\n\nБыло: 20 октября, 14:00\nСтало: **21 октября, 15:00**\nМастер: Фатима\n\nЕсли
  новое время не подходит — нажмите «🔁 Перенести».» A pending notice of the same appointment is replaced (a move
  without the flag just drops it). Without Telegram (or without the flag) nothing is sent, nor for a move into the past
  or of an appointment that is not `scheduled` / `confirmed`; the sender skips a notice whose appointment is no longer
  active. Reminders are rescheduled as before either way.
- Consumption: `consumables` **omitted or `null`** → the server deducts the norms of the appointment's services
  (Σ over its service lines of each service's `consumables`, quantity-mode only), never failing: a consumable short of
  stock gives what it has and is reported. `consumables` given (an array, `[]` included) → exactly those, and a shortage
  is `409 insufficient_stock` (older builds always send the array). Usage is recorded once per appointment: a repeated
  `complete` writes nothing. A sale that completes a not yet completed appointment (`POST /sales` with `appointmentId`,
  also via QR) deducts the norms the same way when nothing was recorded.
  `Consumption`: `{ "used": [ { "productId": 12, "productName": "Игла 1.2", "quantity": 1 } ], "shortages": [ {
  "productId": 15, "productName": "Перчатки", "needed": 2, "deducted": 1 } ] }` (`[]`/`[]` when nothing).
- `complete`: sets `status = completed`, `completedAt = now`; writes `usage` movements for `consumables` (the only
  size of the product unless `variantId` is given; a product with several sizes needs `variantId`: `409 conflict` asking
  to update the app otherwise); when
  `sendAftercare`, the client has Telegram linked and `botEnabled`, **and at least one of the appointment's catalog
  services has `freshProcedure`**, schedules the aftercare template steps (template = `aftercareTemplateId` ?? the
  template of the first such service that has one). An appointment without a fresh procedure (only a jewelry change,
  say, or no catalog services) gets no memo whatever the app sends: `scheduledMessages: 0`. Cancels pending reminders
  of this appointment.
- Creating/rescheduling an appointment for a Telegram-linked client schedules one reminder per
  `BotSettings.reminderOffsets` entry (minutes before `startsAt`; if `remindersEnabled` and that moment is in the
  future). Cancelling / no-show / rescheduling (from the app or by the client through the bot) cancels or replaces
  pending reminders.

#### Moving an appointment in the calendar (app)
Long press on an appointment in the day / 3-day / week calendar lifts it; dragging moves it in time (snapped to 15
minutes; the duration is kept) and, in views with several days, to another day; in the day view with master columns,
to another master (owner and admin only). On release the app asks «Перенести запись Анны на 21 октября, 15:00?»
with «Уведомить клиента в Telegram» (on by default; hidden when the client has no Telegram or the new time has
already passed) and sends `PATCH` with `startsAt`, `endsAt` (and `masterId`), `notifyClient`. A `schedule_conflict`
asks «Записать всё равно?» and retries with `force: true`; cancelling or an error puts the appointment back. A master
can lift only their own appointments; completed, cancelled and no-show appointments are not draggable (nor one that
runs past midnight — it is moved in the editor).

### Prepayments (deposits)
Every prepayment movement is a `DepositOperation`; the appointment's `deposit` (held amount) and `depositStatus` are
derived from them. Money is counted once — when it is received:
- **Receive** — `POST /appointments/:id/deposit` (client paid at the studio: cash / card / transfer) or a paid
  prepayment QR code (method `qr`, recorded by the server). Allowed for `scheduled` / `confirmed` appointments only
  (`409` otherwise). Cash needs an open shift (`409 «…откройте кассовую смену»`) and counts in its
  `summary.deposits.cash` / `expectedCash`. Receiving more than `depositRequired` is allowed.
- **Apply** — at checkout the sale sends `payments.deposit` (≤ held, see Sales); the server writes an `apply`
  operation. The drawer and the payment methods of that sale count only what is paid now.
- **Sale refund** — the sale's `payments.deposit` part goes back to the appointment (`unapply`): staff then apply it
  to a new sale, refund it or retain it.
- **Refund** — `POST …/deposit/refund`: `amount` defaults to the whole held amount (≤ held), `method` to the method of
  the latest receive (`qr` = returned through the Tochka internet bank, the app only records it). Cash needs an open
  shift and is taken from the drawer (`summary.deposits.cashRefunded`). `409` when nothing is held.
- **Retain** — `POST …/deposit/retain`: the studio keeps the prepayment after a cancellation / no-show (only for
  `cancelled` / `no_show` appointments, `409` otherwise); `amount` defaults to the whole held amount.
- `reason` / `note` — free text (≤ 500), stored in the operation `note`.

**Prepayment QR codes** — `POST /appointments/:id/deposit/qr` registers a one-off SBP QR code for
`amount` (default `depositRequired − deposit`; `409 «Предоплата уже внесена»` when that is ≤ 0) and cancels the
appointment's other pending prepayment codes. Only for `scheduled` / `confirmed` appointments; `409` when QR payments
are not configured, `502 payment_provider_error` when the bank fails.
- `delivery: "screen"` — shown on the phone at the studio, valid 10 minutes (the app polls `GET /qr-payments/:id`).
- `delivery: "telegram"` — the bot sends the link to the client; `delivery: "link"` — not sent, staff share
  `payload` themselves. Both stay valid until the appointment starts (at least 30 minutes, at most 72 hours).
- Telegram delivery goes to the client's chat (the linked chat, else the latest chat attributed to the client), or to
  `chatId` (e.g. the booking request's chat — it is then attributed to the client). Before registering the code the
  server checks there is a chat and the bot is running (`409` otherwise).
- `POST …/deposit/remind` — sends the latest pending link again with a reminder text (when it has ≥ 15 minutes left),
  otherwise registers a fresh link (cancelling the old one) and sends it. `409` when nothing is left to pay.

`DepositLinkResult`:
```json
{ "appointment": Appointment, "payment": QrPayment, "sendError": null }
```
`sendError` — why the bot could not deliver the link (client blocked the bot…); the code stays valid, staff can share
`payload` another way. `payment.sentAt` is set when delivered.

When the bank confirms a prepayment code (app poll or the background check), the server records a `receive`
(`method: "qr"`, the open shift if any), sends the client a thank-you message in Telegram (when the chat is known) and
notifies the staff chat. Money is always recorded, even when it arrives on a cancelled / replaced code, for a
cancelled or already paid appointment, or above `depositRequired`: such a payment gets an `error` on the `QrPayment`
and a staff alert, and staff refund or keep the extra. Pending prepayment codes are checked at most once a minute in
the background.

### History
`HistoryEntry` — one thing done for or sold to a client:
```json
{ "id": "as10", "kind": "service", "date": "...", "name": "Соски — Два",
  "serviceId": 3, "productId": null, "variantId": null, "variantName": null,
  "quantity": 1, "price": 4000, "total": 4000,
  "client": { ClientRef } | null, "employee": { EmployeeRef } | null,
  "appointmentId": 12, "saleId": 40, "saleNumber": 17, "refunded": false }
```
- Services come from **completed** appointments: one entry per service line (`id` `as<line id>`), or one entry named
  after the appointment `title` («Процедура» when empty, `id` `at<appointment id>`, price = appointment price) when
  the appointment has no lines. `date` = `startsAt`, `employee` = master, `saleId`/`saleNumber` = the paying sale.
- Products come from sale items of type `product` (`id` `si<item id>`, `date` = sale time, `employee` = seller);
  `variantId` / `variantName` — the size sold (as in the sale item; `null` for services). `?variantId=` on
  `GET /products/:id/history` keeps one size.
  Service items of a sale count only when the sale is not linked to an appointment (otherwise the appointment
  already lists them).
- `refunded`: the sale (of the item, or the one that paid for the appointment) was refunded.
- Used by `GET /clients/:id/history` (`items`, all entries), `GET /services/:id/history` and
  `GET /products/:id/history` (paginated, default limit 50, max 200).

### Open receipts (POS)
| Method | Path | Body | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/receipts` | — | `{ items: [OpenReceipt] }` oldest first |
| GET | `/receipts/:id` | — | `OpenReceipt` · `404` «Чек уже оплачен или удалён» |
| POST | `/receipts` | `{ appointmentId?, clientId?, items?, discount?, note? }` | `OpenReceipt` · accepts `Idempotency-Key` |
| PUT | `/receipts/:id` | `{ appointmentId?, clientId?, items, discount?, note? }` | `OpenReceipt` |
| DELETE | `/receipts/:id` | — | `{ "ok": true }` · `404` when already gone |

- `items`: `[{ type, productId?, variantId?, serviceId?, name?, quantity, price?, recipientName?, note? }]` (≤ 100) —
  the shape of sale items, a certificate to sell included (`{ "type": "certificate", "price": 5000, "recipientName":
  "Маше" }`: quantity 1, nominal 500…100 000, never discounted — the same `400`s as in a sale).
  Product lines need an existing sellable product (`400` for a consumable or a missing one) and one of its current
  sizes (`variantId`; omitted → its only size; several sizes → `400` «Выберите размер «Лабрет»»). Service lines need
  `name` unless `serviceId` is given. `price` defaults to the catalog price (the size's ?? the product's, the service's).
  Stock is not checked here: the sale checks it.
- `POST /receipts` with `appointmentId` — «Начать визит» (the appointment moves to the POS). If the appointment already
  has an open receipt, that receipt is returned unchanged (two devices starting one visit share it). Otherwise a new
  one: `clientId` defaults to the appointment's client; `items` omitted → the appointment's service lines (one per
  booked line when their prices add up to the appointment price, otherwise one line at the appointment price named
  like the appointment: its services, else `title`, else «Услуга»). The appointment must be unpaid and `scheduled` /
  `confirmed` / `completed`: `409` «Запись уже оплачена (чек №17)» / «Запись отменена — верните её в расписание, чтобы
  открыть чек». Without `appointmentId` — a receipt with what was sent (empty is fine).
- `PUT /receipts/:id` replaces the whole receipt (the app sends all of it; omitted `appointmentId`/`clientId`/`note`
  = none, `discount` = 0). Linking it to an appointment that has another open receipt → `409`; `0 ≤ discount ≤
  subtotal` (`400`).
- `DELETE /receipts/:id` removes the open receipt and nothing else: no stock moves, a prepayment stays held, the
  appointment keeps its status and is back among the unpaid ones (`receiptId: null`).
- Paying: `POST /sales` and `POST /qr-payments` take an optional `receiptId`. The sale deletes that receipt (if it
  still exists) in its own transaction, and also the open receipt of the sale's `appointmentId` — so sales from older
  builds and QR payments confirmed later close it too.
- Cancelling an appointment or marking it `no_show` deletes its open receipt.

### Sales (POS)
| Method | Path | Body | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/sales?from=&to=&clientId=&limit=&offset=` | — | `{ items: [Sale], total }` newest first |
| GET | `/sales/:id` | — | `Sale` |
| POST | `/sales` | see below | `Sale` · accepts `Idempotency-Key` |
| POST | `/sales/:id/refund` | `{ reason, restock: true }` | `Sale` (status `refunded`) · accepts `Idempotency-Key` |

`POST /sales` body:
```json
{ "clientId": 1, "appointmentId": 4,
  "items": [ { "type": "product", "productId": 1, "variantId": 5, "quantity": 1, "price": 1500 },
             { "type": "service", "serviceId": 3, "name": "Прокол мочки", "quantity": 1, "price": 2500 } ],
  "discount": 500, "payments": { "cash": 1500, "card": 0, "transfer": 0, "qr": 0, "deposit": 2000, "bonus": 0,
  "certificates": [ { "code": "MIKAN-7K3Q-9F2D", "amount": 1000 } ] }, "note": null,
  "receiptId": 7 }
```
- A certificate is sold as an item `{ "type": "certificate", "price": 5000, "recipientName": "Маше", "note": null }`
  (quantity 1 — `400` otherwise, any nominal 500…100 000; `recipientName` ≤ 100 and `note` ≤ 500 characters are kept
  on the certificate): the sale issues it (see «Gift certificates»), the buyer is the sale's client. A sale with a
  certificate item cannot be paid with bonuses or certificates (`400` «Подарочный сертификат нельзя оплатить бонусами
  или другим сертификатом») and earns no bonuses on that item. The discount never applies to a certificate line (its
  nominal is what the buyer pays): `discount ≤ subtotal − certificate lines` (`400`). An open receipt keeps a
  certificate line until checkout; the app sends it in the sale's `items` as `type: "certificate"` like any line.
- `payments.bonus` needs a client (`clientId`, or the appointment's: `400` «Чтобы оплатить бонусами, выберите
  клиента») and loyalty on (`409` «Бонусная программа выключена — оплатите другим способом»); at most the client's
  balance (`409` «На счёте 1 200 бонусов») and at most `maxPaymentPercent` of `total`, rounded down (`400` «Бонусами
  можно оплатить не больше 30% чека — 1 500 ₽»).
- `payments.certificates` (≤ 10) — codes (case, dashes and the `MIKAN` prefix optional) and amounts spent: each code
  known (`400` «Сертификат … не найден»), listed once (`400`), active and not expired (`409` «Сертификат … не
  действует: срок действия истёк» / «…: он уже использован» / «…: он аннулирован»), amount ≤ its balance (`409` «На
  сертификате … осталось 800 ₽»); the sum is `payments.certificate`.
- `receiptId` — the open receipt being paid (optional): deleted together with the sale (see «Open receipts»).
- `price` per item is the unit price actually charged (defaults to the catalog price if omitted: for a product, the
  size's price ?? the product's).
- Product items name the size in `variantId` (a current size of `productId`, `400` otherwise). Without `variantId`
  (older builds) the product's only size is sold; a product with several sizes → `409 conflict` «У «Лабрет» несколько
  размеров. Обновите приложение MIKAN, чтобы выбрать размер.». Consumables cannot be sold (`400`).
- `subtotal = Σ quantity × price`; `total = subtotal − discount` (`0 ≤ discount ≤ subtotal`);
  `cash + card + transfer + qr + deposit + bonus + Σ certificates` must equal `total` (`400` otherwise). Older
  builds send none of the new keys (= 0).
- `payments.deposit` — the appointment's held prepayment counted in this receipt: needs `appointmentId` (`400`
  otherwise) and must not exceed the held amount (`409`). The app applies `min(held, total)`; a remainder stays held
  for the appointment (staff refund or retain it). If the appointment holds a prepayment and the body has no
  `payments.deposit` key (older builds) → `409 conflict` asking to update the app, so the prepayment is not charged twice.
- `payments.qr > 0` is rejected here (`400`): a sale with a QR share is created by the server through `/qr-payments`.
- The app no longer offers card payments (cash, transfer and QR only); `payments.card` stays in the API for older
  sales and older app builds.
- Product items decrement the stock of their size (`sale` movements); quantities of one size are summed across lines
  before the check; insufficient stock → `409 insufficient_stock` ("Недостаточно на складе: Лабрет — 8 мм (осталось 0)",
  or "Лабрет (осталось 0)" for a product without sizes). Whole sale is one transaction.
- With `appointmentId`, the appointment gets `saleId` (and is marked `completed` if not already, without aftercare).
- Refund: gives back the bonuses and certificate amounts the sale was paid with and takes back the bonuses it earned
  (see «Loyalty bonuses», «Gift certificates»); a sale that sold a certificate already spent in part → `409`
  «Сертификат … уже частично оплачен покупками — чек вернуть нельзя».
- Refund: marks `refunded`, returns product stock to the sold size (`return` movements; an archived size comes back to
  the list — unless the product now has a current size with the same name, which then gets the stock) when `restock`;
  a cash refund is attributed
  to the currently open shift (`summary.cashRefunds`). The `payments.deposit` part is not paid out: it becomes the
  appointment's held prepayment again (`unapply`).

### QR payments (SBP via Tochka Bank)
| Method | Path | Body | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/qr-payments/config` | — | `{ "enabled": true }` — `false` when the server has no Tochka credentials |
| POST | `/qr-payments` | same as `POST /sales`, with `payments.qr > 0` | `QrPayment` (`pending`) · `409` when not configured · `502 payment_provider_error` when the bank fails · rate limit 30/min |
| GET | `/qr-payments/:id` | — | `QrPayment` — asks the bank (at most every 2 s) and applies the answer |
| POST | `/qr-payments/:id/cancel` | — | `QrPayment` — checks the bank first, so a payment that has just arrived returns `paid` |

`GET /qr-payments/:id` and `POST /qr-payments/:id/cancel` work for prepayment codes too (`kind: "deposit"`, see
Prepayments); `POST /qr-payments` creates `sale` codes only.

Flow: the app sends the cart; the server validates it like a sale (nothing is written, stock of every size, the bonus
balance and the certificates are checked — nothing is reserved),
registers a one-off SBP QR for `payments.qr` (valid 10 min) and stores the cart with its sizes and prices fixed. The app shows `payload` as
a QR and polls `GET /qr-payments/:id` every ~2 s. When the bank reports the money, the server creates the sale from the
stored cart in one transaction (with the cash/card/transfer parts as sent) and returns it in `sale`; one paid code
always yields at most one sale. A background job checks watched codes every 15 s, so a payment is recorded even if the
app was closed. An unpaid code becomes `expired` once the bank confirms it unpaid 5 minutes after `expiresAt`; while the
bank cannot be reached the code stays `pending` for up to 24 h (Tochka keeps paid codes readable that long). A cancelled
code is still watched: if the client pays it anyway, it becomes `paid` with an `error` and no sale (staff may already
have taken the money another way). Refunds of the QR part are made in the Tochka internet bank (the app only marks the
sale refunded).

### Cash register
| Method | Path | Body | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/cash/shift/current` | — | `{ "shift": CashShift \| null }` |
| POST | `/cash/shift/open` | `{ openingCash }` | `CashShift` · `409 conflict` if one is open |
| POST | `/cash/shift/close` | `{ closingCash, note? }` | `CashShift` (closed) |
| POST | `/cash/operations` | `{ type: "in"\|"out", amount > 0, reason }` | `CashOperation` · `409` without open shift · accepts `Idempotency-Key` |
| GET | `/cash/shifts?limit=&offset=` | — | `{ items: [CashShift], total }` newest first |
| GET | `/cash/shifts/:id` | — | `CashShift` with `operations` |

### Reports
`GET /reports/growth?from=&to=` (instants; owner, admin; ≤ 400 days) — how the studio grows:

```
Same limits and `400` messages as the analytics. A **visit** is a completed appointment (dated by `startsAt`); days
between visits are studio-local calendar days.
- `funnel.bookingRequests` — booking requests created in the period by status (`open` = still `new`).
- `funnel.online` — online bookings (`channel` ≠ `app`) created in the period: `byChannel` (every channel listed,
  zeros included) and what became of them, so `created = confirmed + rejected + expired + cancelledByClient +
  awaiting`: `awaiting` — still unsettled (`onlineState` set, not closed); `rejected` — staff rejected it, or cancelled
  it while it still waited; `expired` — the prepayment hold ran out; `cancelledByClient` — cancelled on the booking
  page (before or after confirmation); `confirmed` — the rest (confirmed or paid, whatever happened to the visit
  later). `completed` — those whose visit is completed (part of `confirmed`).
- `funnel.appointments` — all appointments created in the period: `byChannel` (`app`, `bot`, `miniapp`, `web`, zeros
  included) and their current `completed` / `cancelled` / `noShow` counts.
- `load` — every active master (`isMaster`): `workingMinutes` — working time in the period from their work schedule
  (the studio hours when none; minus breaks and days off); `bookedMinutes` — time inside the period covered by their
  non-cancelled, non-no-show appointments (overlapping ones count once; time outside the schedule counts too, so the
  load may exceed 100 %); `completedMinutes` — the same for completed ones; `loadPercent = round(booked / working ×
  100)`, `null` when the master had no working time. `byWeekday` — always 7 entries (1 = Monday … 7 = Sunday,
  studio-local; appointments crossing midnight are split). Sorted by `loadPercent` (`null` last).
- `retention` — `newClients` had their first visit in the period; `returnedWithin90Days` — those with another visit on
  a later day within 90 days of the first (counted up to now); `repeatRatePercent` = their share (one decimal, `null`
  without new clients); `averageDaysBetweenVisits` — mean gap between each visit of the period and the same client's
  previous visit day (rounded, `null` when none); `cohorts` — always the 12 studio months up to `to` (the month of its
  last instant), oldest first: `clients` whose first visit fell in that month and how many came back within 30 / 90 /
  180 days of it (counted up to now, so recent cohorts are still filling up).
- `value` — over all time up to `to`: clients with at least one visit or a kept (not refunded) sale;

  revenue from the top `ceil(clients / 10)` clients by revenue (one decimal, `null` without revenue).
- `sources` — the same new clients as `retention.newClients`, by the card's `source` (trimmed, lower-cased; empty →
  «не указан»), with the revenue of their kept sales made in the period; sorted by `newClients`, then `revenue`.
The app shows it in Analytics → «Рост» (owner, admin).

Revenue excludes refunded sales, bonus payments and gift certificates sold, like analytics (a sale's revenue is
`total − payments.bonus − its certificate lines`; item revenue is split as in analytics and certificate lines are left
out of the tops). `byDay` uses the studio timezone and lists every day in range (zeros included).
`payments` splits the money of those sales by how it was paid (`deposit` — covered by prepayments received earlier);
it keeps its older keys, so the bonus and certificate parts are not listed (they are in analytics).
`deposits` — prepayment operations in the period: `received` (+ by method), `applied` (counted in sales, net of
sale refunds), `refunded`, `retained` (kept after cancellations / no-shows; not part of `revenue`); `held` — the total
held for appointments at the end of the period. `held(start) + received − applied − refunded − retained = held(end)`.
`byMaster.revenue` = sales linked to that master's appointments. Item-level revenue is split proportionally to the
sale discount (rounded to whole rubles). `topProducts` are grouped by product (`name` — its current name); `variants`
splits each by size (current size name, `""` for a product without sizes), sorted like the top itself.
`/reports/summary` is kept unchanged for older app builds; current builds read `/reports/analytics`.

#### Analytics
Loyalty in analytics: `revenue` excludes bonus payments and certificate sales (see «Loyalty bonuses», «Gift
certificates»); the response adds `"loyalty": { "bonusEarned", "bonusSpent", "bonusExpired", "bonusOutstanding",
"certificatesSold", "certificatesRedeemed", "certificatesExpired", "certificatesCancelled", "certificatesOutstanding" }`
for the period (outstanding = at the end of it), and `payments` gains `bonus` and `certificate`.
- A sale's **revenue** is `total − payments.bonus − its certificate lines` (paying with a certificate is revenue).
  Every revenue figure below (`gross`, `refunds`, `kept`, days, weekdays, hours, masters, clients) uses it. Item
  revenue splits the sale discount **and** the bonus payment across the lines that are not certificates
  (`allocateDiscount`); certificate lines are left out of services and products. A sale that only sold a certificate
  still counts as a receipt (`salesCount`) with revenue 0.
- `loyalty` (ledger operations in `[from, to)`): `bonusEarned` — credited: cashback earned minus what refunds took
  back, plus gifts and manual adjustments (signed); `bonusSpent` — paid with bonuses minus what refunds gave back;
  `bonusExpired` — burnt; `bonusOutstanding` — on the clients' accounts at `to`. `certificatesSold` — nominals issued;
  `certificatesRedeemed` — spent minus what refunds gave back; `certificatesExpired` — burnt at expiry;
  `certificatesCancelled` — burnt by the owner or by refunding the sale that sold the certificate;
  `certificatesOutstanding` — Σ balances at `to`. So `bonusOutstanding(to) = bonusOutstanding(from) + bonusEarned −
  bonusSpent − bonusExpired`, and `certificatesOutstanding(to) = certificatesOutstanding(from) + certificatesSold −
  certificatesRedeemed − certificatesExpired − certificatesCancelled`.

Which sales count where:
- **Made** sales — created in the period, whatever their status now (a receipt refunded later was still made then).
- **Refunds** — sales refunded during the period (`refundedAt`), whenever they were made.
- **Kept** sales — the made sales that are still `completed`. Every breakdown below `revenue` (services, products,
  margins, weekdays, hours, masters, clients) counts kept sales only, so a returned receipt never inflates tops or
  margins. Item revenue is net of the sale discount, split as in the summary (`allocateDiscount`).

Fields:
- `totals` — headline numbers of the period; `previous` — the same keys for the previous period (the app shows
  deltas; a delta against `0` is shown as «—»). `servicesRevenue` / `productsRevenue` = `services.revenue` /
  `products.revenue`; `cogs`, `grossProfit`, `marginPercent` as in `products`; `stockExpenses` = `stock.expenses`;
  `newClients` as in `clients`; `appointmentsCompleted` / `noShows` / `noShowLoss` as in `appointments`;
  `depositsReceived` = `deposits.received`.
- `revenue`: `gross` — Σ revenue of made sales, `salesCount` — their number, `averageCheck = round(gross / salesCount)`
  (`0` without sales), `discounts` — Σ their discounts; `refunds` / `refundsCount` — refunded in the period;
  `net = gross − refunds` («Выручка»); `kept` — Σ revenue of kept sales (= `services.revenue + products.revenue`);
  `payments` — how the made sales were paid, every way (`deposit` — covered by prepayments received earlier): it sums
  to `gross + payments.bonus +` the certificates those sales sold.
- `byDay` — every studio-local day of the range, zeros included: `gross` and `salesCount` of sales made that day,
  `refunds` made that day, `net = gross − refunds` (Σ `byDay.net` = `revenue.net`).
- `byWeekday` — always 7 entries, `weekday` 1 = Monday … 7 = Sunday; `byHour` — always 24 entries, `hour` 0–23. Both
  bucket kept sales by their studio-local time (`revenue` = Σ totals, `salesCount`).
- `services` — service items: `quantity` (Σ item quantities), `revenue`; `byCategory` by the catalog service's
  `category` (`other` for custom lines and deleted services), by revenue; `top` — up to 20 services by revenue
  (grouped by catalog service, named by its current name; custom lines grouped by name).
- `products` — product items with margin keys: `quantity`, `revenue`, `cogs` = Σ quantity × current unit cost
  (`variant.cost ?? product.cost`), `revenueWithCost` — revenue of the units whose cost is known,
  `grossProfit = revenueWithCost − cogs`, `marginPercent = grossProfit / revenueWithCost × 100` (one decimal, `null`
  when `revenueWithCost` is 0), `itemsWithoutCost` — sold units whose cost is unknown (left out of `cogs` and
  `revenueWithCost`; the app asks to fill in the cost). The same keys appear in `byKind` (one entry per product
  `kind` that sold, by revenue — any kind the server has, apps show unknown kinds by their raw name), in `top` (up to
  20 products by revenue, current names) and in each top product's `variants` (by size, current size name, `""` for a
  product without sizes; items sold before sizes existed have no size entry). Costs are today's, not the ones at sale
  time.
- `stock` — `writeoffs` and `usage` (consumables used in procedures) recorded in the period: `quantity` (units),
  `value` at the current unit cost, `unitsWithoutCost`; `purchases` — restocks of presence consumables: `count` and
  `value` (the amounts paid); `expenses = writeoffs.value + usage.value + purchases.value`; `top` — up to 20 products
  by value (`type`: `writeoff` | `usage` | `purchase`; for `purchase` `quantity` is the number of purchases). `onHand` — a snapshot **now**, not at the
  end of the period: units in stock of every product (inactive ones included), their value at cost,
  `unitsWithoutCost`, and the same split `byKind`.
- `deposits` — exactly the summary's prepayments block.
- `cash` — `cashIn` / `cashOut` / `operationsCount`: cash register operations of the period. Shifts **closed** in the
  period: `shiftsClosed`, `closingDifference` = Σ (`closingCash − expectedCash`), its negative part `shortage` (≤ 0)
  and positive part `surplus` (≥ 0); `openingDifference` = Σ (`openingCash` − `closingCash` of the shift before).
  `shifts` — those shifts with any discrepancy, newest first (≤ 20): `openingDifference` is `null` for the very first
  shift.
- `masters` — masters with completed appointments or no-shows in the period, or with kept sales linked to their
  appointments: `revenue` / `salesCount` / `averageCheck` of those sales, `appointmentsCompleted`, `noShows`,
  `servicesCount` (service lines of completed appointments; an appointment without lines counts once). Sorted by
  revenue, then completed appointments.
- `clients` — `newClients`: cards created in the period; `buyers`: clients with kept sales; `firstTime` / `returning`
  split them (`count`, `revenue`) — returning means a completed sale or a completed appointment before `from`
  (history imported from another CRM counts); `anonymous` — kept sales without a client; `top` — up to 10 clients by
  revenue with their `salesCount` and `visits` (completed appointments in the period). Apps open the client card from it.
- `appointments` — appointments **starting** in the period: `total`, `open` (`scheduled` + `confirmed`),
  `completed`, `cancelled`, `noShow`; `noShowLoss` = Σ `price` of no-shows, `cancelledValue` = Σ `price` of cancelled.

### Online booking (все каналы записи)
Clients book any active service themselves, through every channel: the AI in Telegram (`book_appointment`), the
Telegram Mini App and the booking page (`PUBLIC_URL/book`, the link for Instagram, Yandex Maps and 2GIS). All channels
use one engine and the rules below.

**What a client books.** 1–5 items `{ serviceId, variant? }` (active catalog services; `variant` — a variant `name`),
a master or «any», a start. Duration = Σ durations (variant's, else the service's; 60 min when none), `price` = Σ
prices (variant's, else `price`), `depositRequired` = Σ `depositAmount`. The appointment gets the service lines like
`POST /appointments` with `services` (a variant line is named `"<service> — <variant>"`). A service with variants
needs one («Выберите вариант услуги «Соски»: Один, Два»).

**Free time.** Starts on the `onlineBooking.stepMinutes` grid from the beginning of the master's working day (own
schedule minus breaks, else studio hours — see «WorkSchedule»), at least `leadMinutes` from now, at most `horizonDays`
ahead, the whole duration inside working time and not overlapping the master's non-cancelled, non-no-show
appointments (online holds included). The bot's `free_slots` follows the same settings. «Any master» = every active
master (`isMaster`); a booking for «any» goes to a free master at that start — the one with the fewest appointments
that day, then the lowest id.

**The client.** By phone (normalized): the existing client card, else a new one (`name`, `phone`, source
`онлайн-запись` from the page, `telegram` from the Mini App). In the bot and the Mini App the chat's linked client is
used (the phone was shared at start); a Mini App chat without one sends name and phone like the page. A typed phone
proves nothing, so that chat is **not** linked to the card by it: the bot answers the booking in that chat and then asks
«Чтобы уведомления о записи приходили сюда, нажмите «📱 Поделиться номером» внизу 👇 Это нужно сделать один раз.»
with the phone button — the person's own contact links the chat to the card with that phone (see «Staff chats»). At
most 2 unsettled online bookings per client: a third → `409` «У вас уже есть записи, которые ждут подтверждения —
дождитесь ответа студии». One person is never booked twice at overlapping times (a double submit for «any master»):
`409` «У вас уже есть запись на это время».

**Settlement.**
- `depositRequired > 0` and QR payments configured → `onlineState: awaiting_payment`, `holdUntil = now +
  holdMinutes`, and a prepayment QR code (`QrPayment` `kind: deposit`, amount `depositRequired`, valid until
  `holdUntil`; its `employee` is the booked master — no one issued it). Paid (the usual bank confirmation, or a
  prepayment staff took at the studio meanwhile) → `onlineState: null`: confirmed. Not paid by `holdUntil` (the bank
  confirms unpaid) → `status: cancelled`, «Предоплата не внесена вовремя» added to the notes, the code cancelled, the
  time free; the client is told when there is a chat. While the bank cannot be asked the time stays held, at most an
  hour past `holdUntil`. A payment arriving after the release is recorded with a staff alert, as for any cancelled
  appointment.
- Otherwise (no prepayment, QR payments not configured, or the bank did not issue the code) → `onlineState:
  awaiting_confirmation`: the time is held until staff confirm (`…/online/confirm`) or reject (`…/online/reject`) it in
  the app. Rejecting adds «Онлайн-запись отклонена: <reason>» to the notes; a prepayment code it had is cancelled.
- Staff are told in the staff chat (and by push): «🆕 Онлайн-запись (сайт): Анна, +7…, Мочка — 21 октября, 15:00,
  мастер Фатима · ждёт подтверждения» / «· ждёт оплату до 14:35» (channel: `сайт` | `Mini App` | `бот`; the client's
  comment on a second line «Комментарий: …») / «💳 Онлайн-запись оплачена: … · предоплата 1 000 ₽» (instead of the usual
  «💳 Предоплата … получена»); a released hold — «⌛ Онлайн-запись №… снята — предоплата не поступила вовремя: …».
- The client with a Telegram chat (the chat linked to the card; the Mini App chat that booked) gets: on booking —
  «Заявка принята, время за вами 🙌 Подтвердим в ближайшее время.» with the time, services and master, or the payment
  request with the link button «💳 Оплатить предоплату»; on confirmation or payment — «✅ Запись подтверждена: 21
  октября, 15:00, мастер Фатима, адрес…» and the services, plus the cancellation rule line when the booking has a
  prepayment (instead of the usual thanks for a prepayment); on rejection — the reason and the booking link
  (`PUBLIC_URL/book`); on release — «⌛ Время … освободилось — предоплата не поступила вовремя.» and the booking link.
  In the bot the AI tells the booking itself; only the payment request follows its reply. Reminders are scheduled as for
  any appointment.
- Background: unpaid holds are checked every minute.
- Audit: the booking is logged with source `bot` / `online`, its release with `system`.

**Booking page and Mini App** (`PUBLIC_URL/book`, static files in `server/public/book` served by the server; `/book/*`
paths that are not files return the page, a missing `.js` / `.css` / `.png`… → `404`).
One mobile-first page in Russian: service (categories → groups → services with photo, price text, duration, variants)
→ master or «Любой мастер» → a day strip and free starts → name, phone, comment → confirm. With a prepayment it shows
the QR / bank link, a countdown to `holdUntil` and waits for the payment; otherwise «Ждёт подтверждения». Then the
booking page `/book/b/<token>`: status, details, «Добавить в календарь» (`.ics`), «Получать уведомления в Telegram»
(`https://t.me/<bot>?start=b_<token>`), «Отменить запись». `?service=<id>&master=<id>` preselects (`?wait=…&start=…` — the waitlist's
freed-time button, see «Waitlist»). Inside Telegram
(opened from the bot's menu button «📅 Записаться» or `https://t.me/<bot>/book`) it uses the Telegram theme, the
MainButton, skips name and phone for a linked chat and sends the Mini App init data; the bot confirms in the chat.
Link previews (Open Graph): «Запись в MIKAN STUDIO».
- Caching: the HTML is `no-cache` (ETag); it loads its scripts and styles from `/book/v/<content hash>/…`, cached for a
  year (`immutable`); plain `/book/<file>` (icons, `og.png`) for an hour. Link previews use `PUBLIC_URL` (else the
  request's origin) for `og:url` / `og:image`.
- A linked Mini App chat posts the booking without `name` and `phone` (the chat's client is used). When `/me` answers
  `401` the page stops sending the init data and books like the website (name and phone).
- `items` in `/days` and `/slots` is built as `serviceId[:encodeURIComponent(variant)]` and then encoded once more as a
  query value: the server splits the decoded value on `,` / `:` and decodes each variant.

  active master, a start before `leadMinutes` or past `horizonDays` → `400`; a start that is not free (taken, off the
  grid, outside working time) → `409 schedule_conflict` — never naming another client. `enabled: false` → `403`
  «Онлайн-запись временно недоступна» (`days`, `slots`, booking; `config`, `services`, `masters` still answer).
- Every public route is limited per IP (120 reads / 20 writes a minute); booking itself 5 an hour per IP — only
  bookings made count (honeypot hits included), so taken times and invalid input never lock a person out.
- `POST /public/booking` accepts an optional `Idempotency-Key: <UUID>` like the app's writes (see «Conventions»), scoped
  to the key and the endpoint (no employee): a retry with the same key and body gets the stored `PublicBooking` with
  `Idempotent-Replayed: true` and books nothing; a retry arriving while the first is still running waits for it; the same
  key with another body → `409 conflict`; a malformed key → `400`. Errors are not stored.
- Mini App init data is checked as Telegram documents (HMAC-SHA256 with the key `HMAC("WebAppData", bot token)`,
  `auth_date` within 24 h); the Telegram user id is the chat id.
- `/start b_<token>` in the bot answers with the booking: number, time, services, master and status («ждёт предоплату
  до 14:35» / «ждёт подтверждения студии» / «подтверждена ✅» / «отменена» / «завершена»). A booking link proves
  nothing about who opens it, so it does not link the chat itself: a chat not linked to any client also gets the usual
  request to share the phone, and the shared contact links it to the card with that phone — later notices of the
  booking then go to Telegram. A chat already linked to the booking's client is greeted «Анна, нашёл вашу запись ✅ …
  Сюда придут уведомления о ней и напоминание перед визитом.» An unknown token — «Не нашёл эту запись — возможно, ссылка
  устарела.» and the greeting.
- The bot sets its menu button to the Mini App («📅 Записаться», `web_app` → `PUBLIC_URL/book`) at start (only for an
  `https://` `PUBLIC_URL`; a failure is logged). After the `/start` greeting a client chat also gets «📅 Записаться можно
  прямо здесь: выберите услугу, мастера и свободное время — это займёт минуту.» with the inline `web_app` button
  «📅 Записаться онлайн», while online booking is on.

### Client cabinet (личный кабинет)
The client's own page: `PUBLIC_URL/book/me` (the same static app as the booking page). In the Mini App the client is
known by the Telegram init data (the chat's linked card). On the website the client signs in with a link from the
bot: «👤 Мои записи и бонусы» in the bot (the button of the client keyboard, the `/me` command, `/start me`, a phrase
the AI recognises — tool `cabinet_link`) sends `PUBLIC_URL/book/me#t=<token>` (valid 30 days; the page stores the
token and sends `X-Client-Token`). The token rides in the URL fragment so it never reaches request logs; `?t=` is
read as well. Without a linked card the bot first asks to share the phone. Every cabinet endpoint
answers `401` «Войдите через Telegram-бота студии» without a valid identity.

| Method | Path (no staff auth) | Body | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/public/cabinet` | — | `Cabinet` |
| GET | `/public/cabinet/appointments/:id/days?from=&to=` | — | `{ items: [ { date, available } ] }` ≤ 31 dates (default: 14 from today) — free days to move that appointment to |
| GET | `/public/cabinet/appointments/:id/slots?date=` | — | `{ date, durationMin, items: [ { startsAt, masterIds: [<its master>] } ] }` — free starts for it that day |
| POST | `/public/cabinet/appointments/:id/reschedule` | `{ startsAt }` | `CabinetAppointment` · the online booking free-time rules, own future scheduled/confirmed appointments only; `409 schedule_conflict` «Это время уже занято»; a prepaid one only until its free changes end (`409`) |
| POST | `/public/cabinet/appointments/:id/cancel` | — | `CabinetAppointment` · own future appointments; cancellation rules apply as for staff (late → the rule's retain when `autoRetain`), staff are told (`client_cancelled`) |
| GET | `/public/cabinet/bonuses` | — | `{ balance, items: [ { type, amount, expiresAt, createdAt, note } ] }` (last 50) |
| DELETE | `/public/cabinet/waitlist/:id` | — | `204` · own entry |
| POST | `/public/cabinet/logout` | — | `204` · ends the website token |

`Cabinet`: `{ client: { name, phone: "+7 *** ***-**-01" }, loyalty: { bonusBalance, expiring } | null,
upcoming: [CabinetAppointment], past: [CabinetAppointment] (last 20), waitlist: [WaitlistEntryPublic],
certificates: [ { code, balance, expiresAt } ] (bought by the client, active), aftercare: [ { appointmentId, date,
title, steps: [ { day, text } ] } ] (memos of the last 60 days) }`.
`CabinetAppointment`: `{ id, startsAt, endsAt, status, onlineState, items: [ { name, price } ], master: { name },
price, deposit, depositRequired, freeCancellationUntil, canReschedule, canCancel, bookingToken }` — `canReschedule` /
`canCancel` false for past, completed or cancelled ones; reschedule and cancel are offered only when online booking
is on. Reschedules and cancellations here are audited as `online`, notify the staff chat (and push) and rebuild the
reminders like the bot does.

- **Identity.** `X-Telegram-Init-Data` (checked as for the booking page) → the client card linked to that Telegram
  chat; an unlinked chat, forged or stale data → `401` (never a fallback to a token). Else `X-Client-Token` → the card
  of a live sign-in link: only its SHA-256 is stored (`client_access_tokens`), each use records `lastUsedAt`, it works
  30 days from issue or until `logout`, and only while the card still has a linked Telegram chat (a chat re-linked to
  another card ends the old card's links). A client keeps at most 5 live links — issuing another deletes the oldest;
  expired links are deleted when a new one is issued. Merging client cards moves the links to the remaining card.
- **Lists.** `upcoming` — `scheduled` / `confirmed` appointments that have not ended, soonest first (one under way is
  listed with `canReschedule` / `canCancel` false); `past` — the rest (completed, cancelled, no-show, ended), newest
  first. `items` — the service lines (else one line with the legacy service or title and the appointment price);
  `deposit` — the prepayment held now; `freeCancellationUntil` — start − `cancellation.freeHours` while the
  appointment is changeable and has a prepayment (held or required), else `null` (also when `freeHours` is 0);
  `bookingToken` — the `/book/b/<token>` page of an online booking, else `null`. `canReschedule` also needs the
  appointment's master to be an active master (online booking only books those) and is false for a prepaid
  appointment past `freeCancellationUntil` (see «Moving»). `loyalty` is `null` while the loyalty
  program is off; `expiring` — `{ amount, at }` of the nearest burning lot (as on the client card). `waitlist` — the
  client's `waiting` and `notified` entries, oldest first (`note` is `null` on entries staff added in the app —
  `channel: app` — as it is theirs). `certificates` — bought by the client (`buyer`), `active`,
  balance > 0, not past `expiresAt`, newest first. `aftercare` — per completed visit of the last 60 days (newest
  first) the template of its first catalog service with `freshProcedure` and a template: `title` = the template name,
  `date` = the studio-local visit date, `steps` by `dayOffset` (`day`).
- **Moving.** Only while online booking is on (`403` «Онлайн-запись временно недоступна» otherwise, also for
  `days` / `slots`); the client's own appointment (another client's or an unknown id → `404` «Запись не найдена»);
  completed → `409` «Визит уже состоялся», cancelled / no-show → `409` «Запись уже отменена», started → `409` «Запись
  уже началась — перенести её можно только через студию». The appointment keeps its master and duration; the new
  start must be a free start of `slots` (the `stepMinutes` grid of the master's working time, its own time not busy,
  nothing overlapping — else `409 schedule_conflict` «Это время уже занято», never naming another client), at least
  `leadMinutes` from now (`400` «Это время уже недоступно — выберите время попозже») and within `horizonDays` (`400`
  «Перенести можно не дальше чем на 60 дней вперёд»). The same start again returns it unchanged. Unlike the bot, a
  prepaid appointment (held or required) cannot be moved here once its free changes are over — the rule reads
  «Бесплатно отменить или перенести запись можно не позднее чем за N часов», and a move to a later day followed by a
  cancellation would make a late cancellation free: `409` «Перенести запись с предоплатой меньше чем за 24 ч до начала
  можно только через студию» (nothing is locked without a prepayment or with `freeHours` 0). The staff chat gets «🔁 Клиент Анна Иванова перенёс запись №12 в личном
  кабинете\nБыло: …\nСтало: …–…\nМочка · мастер Фатима»; audit `appointment.move` («… перенесена клиентом в личном
  кабинете с … на …»).
- **Cancelling.** The same checks (`… отменить её можно только через студию` once started). The appointment is
  cancelled as staff would (pending QR codes and reminders dropped; with `autoRetain` a late cancellation keeps the
  rules' share of the held prepayment, the rest stays held for staff), an unsettled online state is cleared and the note
  «Отменена клиентом онлайн — личный кабинет» is added (the growth report counts it as cancelled by the client). The
  staff chat gets «❌ Клиент отменил запись №12 в личном кабинете: Анна Иванова, +7…, Мочка — 21 октября, 15:00, мастер
  Фатима» (+ «По правилам отмены удержано 500 ₽ предоплаты.», «За записью предоплата 500 ₽ — верните или удержите её по
  правилам в карточке записи.»), the `client_cancelled` push; audit `appointment.status` («… отменена клиентом в личном
  кабинете»). Reschedules send no push (as in the bot).
- **Waitlist.** `DELETE` sets the client's own `waiting` / `notified` entry to `cancelled` (an already cancelled one →
  `204` again); `booked` / `expired` → `409` «Эта запись в листе ожидания уже неактуальна»; another client's →
  `404`.
- **Bonuses.** `GET …/bonuses` answers with loyalty on or off; `note` as staff wrote it.
- **The bot's sign-in message** (linked client chats): «👤 Личный кабинет MIKAN STUDIO: ваши записи (можно перенести
  или отменить), бонусы, памятки по уходу и сертификаты.\n\n«🌐 Открыть в браузере» — вход на сайте без Telegram:
  ссылка действует 30 дней, не пересылайте её никому.» with the inline buttons «👤 Открыть кабинет» (`web_app` →
  `PUBLIC_URL/book/me`; only for an `https://` `PUBLIC_URL`; the Mini App needs no token) and «🌐 Открыть в браузере»
  (URL `PUBLIC_URL/book/me#t=<token>`, a new token per message). The chat history keeps the text, never the link.
  Without `PUBLIC_URL`: «Личный кабинет пока недоступен — спросите здесь, я подскажу по записям и бонусам 🙂». A chat
  that has not shared its phone gets the usual phone request (no token); a staff chat — «Личный кабинет — для клиентов
  студии. Все записи и клиенты есть в приложении MIKAN.». `/start me` (the page's «Получить ссылку в Telegram» for a
  website visitor without a link) greets and sends the sign-in message instead of the booking offer.
- Limited per IP like the public booking routes: 120 reads / 20 writes a minute.
- **The page `/book/me`** (`X-Robots-Tag: noindex`, styles in `cabinet.css`). Website: `#t=` (or `?t=`) is taken out of
  the address bar and kept in `localStorage` (only in memory when storage is off) and sent as `X-Client-Token`; without a
  link, or when the server refuses it, the sign-in screen: «Личный кабинет» / «Ссылка для входа устарела» / «Вы вышли из
  кабинета» with how to get a link, «Получить ссылку в Telegram» (`https://t.me/<bot>?start=me`) and «Записаться
  онлайн». Mini App: the init data only; an unlinked chat sees «Нужен ваш номер» (share the phone in the chat), a
  `401` after the cabinet was shown (init data older than 24 h) «Откройте кабинет заново». An open appointment whose
  time has passed (not closed by staff yet) reads «Визит прошёл».
  Tabs: «Записи» — upcoming appointments (time, status, services, master, price, prepayment, «Бесплатная отмена — до
  …») with «Перенести», «Отменить» and «Оплатить предоплату» / «Страница записи» (`/book/b/<token>`), the waitlist
  with «Не ждать», the history; «Бонусы» — balance, «500 бонусов действуют до 2 ноября», certificates, the history
  (`…/bonuses`, loaded when the tab opens); «Уход» — memos by day with their dates, today's step marked «Сегодня».
  «Перенести» opens the booking flow's day strip and free times (`…/days`, `…/slots`) as a history entry («Назад» and
  Telegram's BackButton return; the MainButton moves in Telegram); a taken time reloads them with the reason.
  «Отменить» asks first and says what it costs: nothing without a prepayment, «Сейчас отмена бесплатная: студия вернёт
  предоплату …» until `freeCancellationUntil`, otherwise that the free cancellation is over plus the config's
  `cancellationText`. «Записаться» (the MainButton in Telegram) opens `/book`; «Выйти» (website) calls `logout` and
  forgets the link. Telegram theme as on the booking page.

### Portfolio
Photos of each master's work, optionally tied to a service. Masters manage their own; owner and admin manage all.

| Method | Path | Body | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/portfolio?employeeId=&serviceId=` | — | `{ items: [PortfolioPhoto] }` in `sort` order (by master, then `sort`) · every role |
| POST | `/portfolio` | `{ employeeId, imageUrl, serviceId?, caption? }` | `PortfolioPhoto` (added last) · `imageUrl` from `POST /uploads` |
| PATCH | `/portfolio/:id` | `{ caption?, serviceId? }` | `PortfolioPhoto` · absent = unchanged, `null` / blank = cleared |
| PUT | `/portfolio/order` | `{ employeeId, ids: [...] }` | `{ items }` · `ids` = every photo of that master, in the new order |
| DELETE | `/portfolio/:id` | — | `204` |
| GET | `/public/booking/masters/:id/portfolio` | — | `{ items: [PublicPortfolioPhoto] }` in the master's order (no auth) |
| GET | `/public/booking/portfolio?serviceId=` | — | `{ items: [PublicPortfolioPhoto] }` every working master's photos of that service, newest first, ≤ 30 |

`PortfolioPhoto`: `{ id, employee: EmployeeRef, imageUrl, caption, service: ServiceRef | null, sort, createdAt }`.
`PublicPortfolioPhoto`: `{ imageUrl, caption, service: { id, name } | null, master: { id, name } }`.
- Rules: `imageUrl` is a `/uploads/<name>` path (anything else → `400`); `caption` ≤ 300 characters; `serviceId` an
  existing service (`400` «Услуга не найдена»); the master an active employee with `isMaster` (`404` «Сотрудник не
  найден», `400` «Портфолио ведётся только у работающих мастеров»); at most 100 photos per master (`400` «В портфолио
  мастера не больше 100 фото»). A master changing another master's photos → `403` «Можно менять только своё
  портфолио». `PUT /portfolio/order` without every photo of the master (or with another master's) → `400` «Перечислите
  все фото мастера», a repeated id → `400` «Фото указано дважды». Unknown photo → `404` «Фото не найдено». Deleting a
  photo leaves the uploaded file in place.
- Public: only working masters (active, `isMaster`) — another id → `404` «Мастер не найден»; a hidden service is not
  named (`service: null`) and `?serviceId=` of one answers no photos; both routes answer while
  online booking is off and are rate-limited like the other public reads. `GET /public/booking/masters` items gain
  `photos` (count) and `cover` (the first photo's URL or `null`); `PublicService` gains `portfolio` — how many photos of
  that service working masters have (the page shows «Работы мастеров» when > 0).
- Booking page: on the master step each master with works shows the cover instead of the initials and «Работы (12)»;
  on the service step a service with works shows «Работы мастеров». Both open a full-screen swipeable gallery (lazy
  images, the caption as `alt`, «3 из 12», arrows and the keyboard; the phone's «Назад» and the Mini App's BackButton
  close it).
- Audit: `portfolio.create` («Фото №12 добавлено в портфолио «Фатима» (услуга «Хеликс»)»), `portfolio.update`
  («Фото №12 в портфолио «Фатима» изменено: подпись, услуга»), `portfolio.order` («Порядок фото в портфолио «Фатима»
  изменён», `entityId` `null`), `portfolio.delete` («Фото №12 удалено из портфолио «Фатима»»); entity `portfolio`, the
  photo's id.
- Bot: the client prompt lists the working masters with ids and how many works each has («## Мастера»). The tool
  `show_portfolio { masterId?, serviceId? }` sends up to 5 photos after the reply, each with a short caption
  «Мастер: **Фатима** · Хеликс» and the photo's own caption: a master's in their order (of that service when given;
  none of it → the master's other works, and the model says so), else every working master's of the service, else the
  studio's newest; at most 5 photos follow one answer however many calls ask, and a hidden service is not named. HEIC
  pictures and missing files are skipped. Nothing to show → the model says so in words.
- App: «Портфолио» on a master's employee card, «Моё портфолио» in More for a master, «Портфолио мастеров» in More for
  owner and admin: a grid; several photos added at once (compressed to ≤ 2048 px JPEG, uploaded, then
  `POST /portfolio`), caption and service per photo, drag to reorder (`PUT /portfolio/order`), delete with
  confirmation.

### Waitlist (лист ожидания)
When the wanted time is taken, a client (or staff for a client) puts a wish on the waitlist: items, a master or any,
a date range of at most 30 days. At most 3 open (`waiting` / `notified`) entries per client.

`WaitlistEntry`: `{ id, client: ClientRef, items: [ { serviceId, variant?, name } ], master: EmployeeRef | null,
dateFrom, dateTo, status: "waiting"|"notified"|"booked"|"cancelled"|"expired", channel, notifiedAt, appointmentId,
note, createdAt }`; `WaitlistEntryPublic` — the same without `client`. `items[].name` — the service's name (`variant`
— the variant's name or `null`); `channel` — `app` | `bot` | `miniapp` | `web`; `dateFrom` / `dateTo` — studio-local
`"YYYY-MM-DD"`, inclusive; `notifiedAt` — the last freed-time message (instant or `null`).

| Method | Path | Body | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/waitlist?status=` | — | `{ items: [WaitlistEntry] }` oldest first · `status` — one or a comma-separated list; closed entries (`booked`, `cancelled`, `expired`) only of the last 90 days |
| POST | `/waitlist` | `{ clientId, items, masterId?, dateFrom, dateTo, note? }` | `WaitlistEntry` (`channel: app`) |
| PATCH | `/waitlist/:id` | `{ status: "cancelled" }` | `WaitlistEntry` · an open entry only (`cancelled` again → as is; `booked` / `expired` → `409` «Эта запись листа ожидания уже закрыта») |
| POST | `/public/booking/waitlist` | `{ items, masterId?, dateFrom, dateTo, name, phone, note?, website? }` (+ init data) | `WaitlistEntryPublic` + `telegramLink` · rate-limited like bookings |

- Every staff role may read, add and cancel entries.
- **Rules** (`400` with the reason unless said otherwise): `items` — 1–5 active services, a variant where the service
  has variants (as in online booking); `masterId` — an active master (`isMaster`) or none («any»); `dateFrom` not
  before today (studio), `dateTo` not before `dateFrom`, at most 30 days inclusive («Период — не больше 30 дней»);
  staff may pick dates up to a year ahead, clients (page, Mini App, bot) up to the last bookable date (`horizonDays`);
  `note` ≤ 500. A fourth open entry of a client → `409 conflict` «В листе ожидания уже 3 заявки этого клиента» (the
  page and the bot: «У вас уже 3 заявки в листе ожидания — дождитесь сообщения или отмените одну из них»). The same
  wish again (same client, items, master and dates, still open) returns the existing entry instead of a copy.
- **The public join** works like `POST /public/booking`: the client by a linked Mini App chat (no `name` / `phone`),
  else by phone — the card with it or a new one (`name` 1…100, source `онлайн-запись` / `telegram`); `website` is the
  honeypot (answered as if joined, nothing stored); 5 joins an hour per IP (only joins made and honeypot hits count)
  besides the 20 writes a minute; `enabled: false` → `403`; invalid init data → `401`. An unlinked Mini App chat is then
  asked in the bot to share its phone («Чтобы сообщение о свободном времени пришло сюда, нажмите «📱 Поделиться
  номером» внизу 👇»). `telegramLink` — `https://t.me/<bot>?start=w_<id>` (`null` while the bot's username is unknown):
  the page shows it on the website so the client can receive the message.
- `/start w_<id>` in the bot: a chat linked to the entry's client gets «Анна, вы в листе ожидания ✅ Мочка, 21–25
  октября. Напишу сюда, как только освободится время.»; any other chat — «Чтобы получить сообщение о свободном
  времени, поделитесь номером — так я найду вашу заявку.» with the share-phone hint (the shared contact links the chat
  to the card with that phone). The link names nothing of the entry to a chat that is not its client's.
- **Freed time.** When an appointment is cancelled, marked no-show, moved (its old time) or an online hold is released
  or rejected, and when a work schedule or an exception adds working time (`PUT /employees/:id/schedule`,
  `PUT …/schedule/days`, `DELETE …/schedule/days`), the freed time is queued and checked within a minute (only while
  online booking is on and the bot runs; freed time that is past or beyond `horizonDays` is dropped). For each freed
  piece (a master, a date, the freed interval) the server looks for open entries (oldest first) whose range covers that
  date, whose master is that master or «any», whose client has a linked Telegram chat (`botEnabled`), told no sooner
  than 24 h ago, and whose items fit a free start of that master that day overlapping the freed interval (the online
  booking rules). Up to 3 entries per freed piece are told in Telegram: «Освободилось время: 21 октября, 15:00 у
  Фатимы — записаться?» + «Мочка — вы в листе ожидания. Время достанется тому, кто запишется первым.» with «📅
  Записаться» (`web_app` → `PUBLIC_URL/book?wait=<id>&start=<iso>&items=<items>&master=<id>`; a plain link when
  `PUBLIC_URL` is not `https://`, no button without it) → status `notified`, `notifiedAt`. Whoever books first gets
  it; an entry is told at most once a day (it stays open and may be told again later).
- **Booked.** Any appointment created for the client (any channel, staff included, not cancelled / no-show) that
  starts inside an open entry's range, with its master when one was chosen and with at least one of its services, marks
  the entry `booked` (`appointmentId`). Entries whose `dateTo` is before today become `expired` (checked hourly).
- **Booking page.** On the time step a day without free time (busy days can be tapped) and «В ближайшие дни всё
  занято» offer «Встать в лист ожидания»: the date range (preset to the day, or the next two weeks; ≤ 30 days), a note
  and, unless the Mini App chat is linked, name and phone → «Вы в листе ожидания ✅» and, on the website, «Получить
  сообщение в Telegram» (`telegramLink`). `?wait=<id>&start=<iso>&items=<items>&master=<id>` (the freed-time button;
  `items` as in `/days`, `master` absent for «any») opens the flow on the time step with those services, the master,
  the day and the time chosen; if the time was taken meanwhile the page says «Это время уже заняли — выберите другое».
- **Bot.** The tool `join_waitlist { items, masterId?, dateFrom, dateTo, note? }` (a client who shared the phone;
  offered when nothing free suits); the chat is linked, so the client is told there.
- **Staff.** The staff chat hears about client joins (bot, Mini App, website): «⏳ Анна Иванова встал(а) в лист
  ожидания (сайт): Мочка, 21–25 октября, мастер Фатима». The app: More → «Лист ожидания» (badge `waitlist` — open
  entries) grouped by status; add for a client (search, services, master or any, dates, note), cancel, open the
  appointment of a booked entry.
- **Audit** (entity `waitlist`, `entityId` the entry): `waitlist.create` (app; `bot` / `online` for client joins),
  `waitlist.cancel` (app), `waitlist.notify` and `waitlist.book` (`system`). Expiry is not logged.

### Offline mode (app)
The app keeps the last loaded schedule (today ± 7 days, with appointment details), clients, the catalog and settings
on the phone. Without a network it shows them read-only under «Нет сети — данные на 14:32»; writes are disabled with
«Нужен интернет». It refreshes as soon as the network is back. No server changes.
- Kept (JSON in Application Support, a format version + `savedAt`, excluded from backups): every master's appointments
  from 7 days before today to 7 days after, the active clients the list loaded, services, products of each kind (with
  sizes), warehouse categories, employees, studio and bot settings. Saved after every successful load; the schedule
  shows from the phone at once and is then refreshed.
- Offline = no network path (`NWPathMonitor`) or the server not answering (no connection, timeout, a proxy's
  502/503/504); any answer brings the app back online. Every request but a GET is refused before it is sent (sign-in
  excepted); a calendar page only partly inside the kept days says which days it shows; clients are searched on the
  phone.
- The till keeps its cart and open receipts; only paying waits for the network, and unsaved receipt edits are sent on
  reconnecting.
- Nothing saved is read before the Face ID lock is passed; signing out deletes it (another employee may sign in).

### Push notifications
Staff iPhones get push notifications through APNs (token auth). Configured by env `APNS_KEY_ID`, `APNS_TEAM_ID`,
`APNS_PRIVATE_KEY` (the `.p8` file content, base64) and `APNS_BUNDLE_ID`; without them nothing is sent (a partial set is
logged once at start).

| Method | Path | Body | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/devices` | `{ token, environment: "production"\|"sandbox" }` | `204` — registers the device for the current employee (a token registered by someone else moves to them) · `400` «Некорректный токен устройства» unless `token` is hex (32–100 digits, any case); an employee keeps their 10 most recently registered devices |
| DELETE | `/devices/:token` | — | `204` — on sign-out; removes only the current employee's own device (an unknown token is fine) |

Events (sent next to the staff chat message about the same thing; a failed push never fails anything):
| Event | Who | Title · body | `data` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `online_booking` | owner, admin, the booked master | «Новая онлайн-запись» · «Анна · Мочка · 21 окт, 15:00 · ждёт подтверждения» | `{ type, appointmentId }` |
| `deposit_paid` | owner, admin, the appointment's master | «Предоплата получена» · «Анна · 2 000 ₽ · запись 21 окт, 15:00» | `{ type, appointmentId }` |
| `client_message` | everyone | «Клиент ждёт ответа» · «Анна: …» (a chat got `needsAttention`) | `{ type, chatId }` |
| `booking_request` | owner, admin | «Новая заявка» · «Анна · Мочка · в субботу после 15:00» | `{ type, bookingRequestId }` |
| `client_cancelled` | owner, admin, the master | «Клиент отменил запись» · «Анна · 21 окт, 15:00» | `{ type, appointmentId }` |

…data ids }` — the `data` fields sit at the top level, e.g. `{ "aps": {…}, "type": "deposit_paid", "appointmentId": 42 }`.
Devices of inactive employees get nothing. A device answered `410` / `BadDeviceToken` / `Unregistered` is deleted.
The app asks for permission after sign-in, registers the token (`POST /devices`), removes it on sign-out, and a tap
opens the appointment, the chat or the list of online bookings.

### Retention settings
`GET /settings/retention` · `PUT /settings/retention` (owner, admin; omitted = unchanged, each field validated)
```json
{ "loyalty": { "enabled": true, "cashbackPercent": 5, "maxPaymentPercent": 30, "expiryDays": null,
               "notifyClient": true },
  "birthday": { "enabled": true, "sendAt": "10:00", "text": "{name}, с днём рождения! 🎂 …",
                "bonusAmount": 500, "bonusDays": 14, "discountPercent": 10, "discountDaysBefore": 7,
                "discountDaysAfter": 7 },
  "winback": { "enabled": true, "afterMonths": 6, "sendAt": "12:00", "text": "{name}, давно не виделись! …",
               "bonusAmount": 0, "bonusDays": 30, "dailyLimit": 50 },
  "certificates": { "validityMonths": 12 } }
```
- `loyalty`: `cashbackPercent` 0…50, `maxPaymentPercent` 0…100, `expiryDays` (1…3650 or `null` = earned bonuses never
  burn), `notifyClient` — the bot tells the client what was credited after a paid sale («+75 бонусов, на счёте
  1 275»). `enabled: false` — nothing is earned or spent; balances stay.
- `birthday`: greeting text (`{name}` = the client's first name) sent at `sendAt` studio time on the birthday;
  `bonusAmount` (0 = none) gift bonuses that burn after `bonusDays`; `discountPercent` (0 = none) — the
  `birthdayDiscount` the app offers at checkout from `discountDaysBefore` days before to `discountDaysAfter` days after.
- `winback`: `afterMonths` 1…24; `text` with `{name}`; optional gift bonuses; `dailyLimit` 1…500 messages a day.
- `certificates.validityMonths` 1…60 or `null` (never expire); default 12.
Defaults as above; texts default to warm Russian greetings.

### Loyalty bonuses
1 bonus = 1 ₽. A completed sale with a client earns `floor(cashbackPercent × base / 100)`, where `base = total −
payments.bonus − payments.certificate − certificate items`. Bonuses are spent at checkout (`payments.bonus`), oldest
lots first. Earned bonuses are available at once; a lot with `expiresAt` burns its unspent rest then (an `expire`
operation, checked hourly). A refund returns the spent bonuses and takes back the earned ones (never below 0).
Bonuses paid count as a discount: analytics `revenue` and payroll revenue exclude them (split across the lines like
the sale discount).

| Method | Path | Body | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/clients/:id/bonuses?limit=&offset=` | — | `{ balance, items: [BonusOperation], total }` newest first |
| POST | `/clients/:id/bonuses` | `{ amount (≠ 0), note, expiresAt? }` | `BonusOperation` (`adjust`) · owner, admin · the balance never goes below 0 (`409` «На счёте только 300 бонусов») |

`BonusOperation`: `{ id, type: "earn"|"spend"|"gift"|"expire"|"adjust"|"reverse", amount, remaining, expiresAt,
saleId, saleNumber, note, employee: EmployeeRef | null, createdAt }`.
- `amount` is signed — credits > 0 (`earn`, `gift`, a positive `adjust`, the `reverse` giving back bonuses paid in a
  refunded sale), debits < 0 (`spend`, `expire`, a negative `adjust`, the `reverse` taking back what a refunded sale
  earned); `remaining` — the unspent rest of a credit (`0` for debits);
  `expiresAt` — when that rest burns (`null` — never; always `null` on debits). `balance` = Σ `remaining` of credits
  that have not burnt: a lot past `expiresAt` leaves the balance at once, its `expire` operation (one per lot, with the
  `saleId` of the sale that earned it) is written by the hourly job.
- Bonuses that burn after N days (`loyalty.expiryDays`, a gift's `bonusDays`) burn at the end of the studio day N days
  from the day they are credited — the client is told «действуют до <that day>».
- `earn` — the cashback of a sale (burns after `loyalty.expiryDays`, never when `null`); `spend` — paid in a sale;
  `gift` — birthday and win-back gifts; `adjust` — by staff: `note` is required, a credit burns at `expiresAt` when
  given (in the future, else `400` «Срок сгорания должен быть в будущем»), a debit takes from the oldest lots.
- Refund of a sale (`reverse`, with the sale and a note): the bonuses paid in it come back first, as a new lot that
  burns like newly earned ones; then the bonuses it earned are taken back, except what of them has already burnt — the
  unspent rest of its own lot, then (for what the client spent of them) from the oldest lots, never below 0. Refunds
  work with loyalty off too.
- After a paid sale that earned bonuses (`POST /sales`, a confirmed QR code) the bot tells the client in the
  **linked** Telegram chat, when `loyalty.notifyClient`, the client's `botEnabled` and the card is not archived:
  «Спасибо за покупку! 🎁 +75 бонусов, на счёте 1 275» (+ « — начисленные действуют до 14 ноября» when they burn). An
  idempotent replay sends nothing.

### Gift certificates
Sold at the till as a sale item (see «Sales»): the sale issues a certificate with a code «MIKAN-XXXX-XXXX» (letters
and digits without look-alikes: no 0/O, 1/I/L), `amount` = `balance` = the price, `expiresAt` = now + `validityMonths`
(studio calendar; `null` when `validityMonths` is `null`). It is spent in parts at checkout (`payments.certificates`)
until the balance is 0 (`used`); after `expiresAt` it is `expired` (checked hourly). Selling counts as money received
but not as revenue (analytics `certificatesSold`); spending counts as revenue of the sale it pays. Refunds: a sale paid
with a certificate gives the amount back to it (`used` → `active`; a certificate past its `expiresAt` or cancelled
since burns it at once); a sale that sold an unspent certificate cancels it (`409` when it was already spent in part).

`GiftCertificate`: `{ id, code, amount, balance, status: "active"|"used"|"expired"|"cancelled", expiresAt,
buyer: ClientRef | null, recipientName, note, saleId, saleNumber, operations: [ { type, amount, saleId, saleNumber,
createdAt } ], createdAt }`.
- `status` is as of now: an active certificate past `expiresAt` reads `expired` (and cannot be spent) before the
  hourly job burns its balance.
- `operations` oldest first. `amount` is signed — credits > 0, debits < 0 — and Σ `amount` = `balance`:
  - `issue` (+ the nominal; `saleId` — the sale that sold it);
  - `redeem` (− spent in sale `saleId`);
  - `refund` (+ given back: sale `saleId` was refunded);
  - `cancel` (− the rest burnt by the owner, or because the sale that sold it was refunded — then with that `saleId`);
  - `expire` (− the rest burnt at `expiresAt`).
- Codes are matched without case, dashes, spaces and the `MIKAN` prefix (Cyrillic look-alike letters are read as
  Latin), everywhere a code is accepted.

| Method | Path | Body | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/certificates?status=&q=&limit=&offset=` | — | `{ items: [GiftCertificate], total }` newest first; `q` — code or recipient |
| GET | `/certificates/:id` | — | `GiftCertificate` · `404` «Сертификат не найден» |
| GET | `/certificates/code/:code` | — | `GiftCertificate` (code case- and dash-insensitive) · `404` «Сертификат не найден» |
| PATCH | `/certificates/:id` | `{ recipientName?, note?, expiresAt? }` | `GiftCertificate` · `expiresAt` owner only (`403`; resent unchanged it counts as untouched), in the future (`400`) or `null` (never expires), not for an expired or cancelled one (`409`) |
| POST | `/certificates/:id/cancel` | `{ reason }` | `GiftCertificate` · owner · active only (`409`) · the balance burns; «Аннулирован: <reason>» is added to `note` |
| POST | `/certificates/:id/send` | `{ chatId? }` | `{ sent: true }` — the bot sends the certificate card to the buyer's chat (or `chatId`, a chat that wrote to the bot: `400` otherwise): «🎁 Подарочный сертификат MIKAN STUDIO на 5 000 ₽ · код MIKAN-7K3Q-9F2D · действует до 19 октября 2027» (+ «Осталось 3 000 ₽», «Кому: Маше» lines) · `409` when it is not active, the buyer never wrote to the bot, the bot is off or Telegram refused |

The app renders a certificate card (studio name, amount, code, valid until, recipient) to share or print. The bot
answers a client who asks about a certificate by code (`certificate_balance { code }`: balance and validity, never
the buyer).

### Campaigns (рассылки)
Owner and admin send Telegram messages to a segment of clients. Recipients are clients with a linked Telegram chat,
`botEnabled`, not `marketingOptOut`, not archived, matching every condition of the segment.

`CampaignSegment` (all optional, combined with AND): `{ "lastVisitMonthsAgoMin": 3, "lastVisitMonthsAgoMax": 12,
"neverVisited": false, "categories": ["piercing"], "masterIds": [2], "minVisits": 2, "birthdayMonth": 11,
"hasBonuses": true, "createdWithinDays": 30 }` — last visit = last completed appointment; `categories` / `masterIds`
— had a completed visit with such a service / master. Months are calendar months in the studio timezone;
`neverVisited` and `hasBonuses` filter only when `true` (`false` = no condition); `hasBonuses` — holds bonuses that
have not burnt; `categories` ⊂ `tattoo` | `piercing` | `other`; `lastVisitMonthsAgoMin` 0…120 ≤ `lastVisitMonthsAgoMax`
1…120, `minVisits` 1…1000, `birthdayMonth` 1…12, `createdWithinDays` 1…3650, ≤ 50 `masterIds` (out of range → `400`).
The output lists every condition, `null` = not used (empty lists read as `null`).

`Campaign`: `{ id, title, text, imageUrl, button: { text, kind: "book"|"url", url? } | null, segment, status:
"draft"|"scheduled"|"sending"|"sent"|"cancelled", scheduledAt, startedAt, finishedAt, stats: { recipients, sent,
failed, blocked, pending }, createdBy: EmployeeRef, createdAt, updatedAt }`. `stats` are zeros until sending starts;
`recipients` also counts the ones skipped (see below), so it can exceed `sent + failed + blocked + pending`.

| Method | Path | Body | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/campaigns` | — | `{ items: [Campaign] }` newest first |
| GET | `/campaigns/:id` | — | `Campaign` (e.g. to follow `stats` while sending) · `404` «Рассылка не найдена» |
| POST | `/campaigns` | `{ title, text, imageUrl?, button?, segment }` | `Campaign` (draft) |
| PATCH | `/campaigns/:id` | any of the above | `Campaign` · drafts and scheduled only |
| POST | `/campaigns/preview` | `{ segment }` | `{ count, sample: [ClientRef] }` (≤ 5, by name) |
| POST | `/campaigns/:id/test` | — | `{ sent: true }` — to the staff chat of the employee (or the group) |
| POST | `/campaigns/:id/send` | `{ at? }` | `Campaign` — `sending` now, or `scheduled` for `at`; also for a scheduled one (see below) |
| POST | `/campaigns/:id/cancel` | — | `Campaign` — stops a scheduled or sending one (sent messages stay) |
| DELETE | `/campaigns/:id` | — | `204` · drafts only |

- Limits (`400 validation_error` otherwise): `title` 1…200 characters; `text` 1…3 500, light Markdown like other bot
  messages, `{name}` = the client's first name; button `text` ≤ 64; the segment ranges above; `at` at most a year
  ahead. `imageUrl` — an upload (`/uploads/…`) or an `https://` link; with it the message is a photo with the text as
  caption, so `text` must then be ≤ 1 024 characters as written (`{name}` counts as its 6 characters; «Текст»: с
  картинкой — не длиннее 1 024 символов (это подпись к фото)). When a client's name makes a caption longer, it is cut
  at the last word boundary with «…» — never refused. A picture Telegram can't take (a missing file, HEIC) is left out
  and the text goes alone.
- `button` (`null` = none): `kind: "book"` — «📅 Записаться» (`text` optional, ≤ 64, default «📅 Записаться»): the
  booking Mini App while `onlineBooking.enabled` and the booking page is `https://`, else a button that stores
  «[Кнопка] 📅 Хочу записаться» as the client's message and the AI books as usual; `kind: "url"` — `text` (≤ 64) and an
  `https://` `url` are required.
- Every campaign message carries «🔕 Не присылать новости» under its own button: the client's `marketingOptOut` turns
  on, the button press and the bot's confirmation («Хорошо, больше не будем присылать новости и предложения 🙌 …») are
  stored in the chat, and the confirmation offers «🔔 Снова получать новости» (turns it off again and removes itself).
  Only a chat linked to a client card can use them. Both are logged as `bot` (see «Audit log»).
- `PATCH` of a campaign that is sending, sent or cancelled → `409` «Рассылку уже нельзя изменить: она отправляется
  или завершена»; `DELETE` of anything but a draft → `409` «Удалить можно только черновик — запущенную рассылку можно
  остановить».
- `test` goes to the employee's own staff chat with the bot, else the staff group bound with `/staff` (where a Mini App
  button becomes a link to the same page), with `{name}` = the employee's name; nothing is stored or changed. `409`
  when there is no such chat («Некуда отправить тест: поделитесь своим номером с ботом в Telegram или привяжите рабочий
  чат командой /staff») or the bot is not running; `502 upstream_error` when Telegram refuses it.
- `send` — a draft or a scheduled campaign (sending, sent or cancelled → `409` «Эта рассылка уже отправляется или
  завершена»). `at` in the future → `scheduled` for it; on a scheduled campaign this moves it («Перенести»). No `at`
  (or a past one) → sending starts now — on a scheduled campaign too («Отправить сейчас»; its `scheduledAt` becomes
  `null`). Starting now is refused with `409 conflict` when the bot is not running («Telegram-бот не запущен —
  проверьте настройки бота») or nobody matches («Под условия рассылки не подходит ни один клиент с Telegram, который
  согласен получать новости»); the campaign stays as it was. A scheduled campaign starts by itself when its time comes,
  with the recipients of that moment (none → it ends `sent` at once and the staff chat is told).
- Recipients are fixed when sending starts; delivery runs in the background (checked every 5 s) at ≤ 20 messages a
  second — together with birthday and win-back messages. A failure is retried after 30 s, 1 min and 1.5 min (the first
  try and up to 3 retries), then `failed`; a client who blocked the bot is `blocked`; Telegram's flood limit (429)
  pauses all of them for the time Telegram asks, without counting a try. A recipient who meanwhile opted out, unlinked
  Telegram, turned the bot off or was archived is skipped. Each outcome is stored before the next message, so a restart
  continues where it stopped (delivery is at least once: a send that timed out after Telegram took it is retried).
  Messages are stored in the chats as `system` (a photo as «[Фото] caption»).
- `cancel` — a scheduled or sending campaign (else `409` «Остановить можно только запланированную или идущую
  рассылку»): whoever was not reached yet is skipped; sent messages stay.
- When a campaign finishes the staff chat gets «📣 Рассылка «Осень» завершена / ✅ Доставлено: 120 из 130 /
  🚫 Заблокировали бота: 6 / ⚠️ Не доставлено: 4 / ➖ Пропущено (отписались или отвязали Telegram): 2» (one line each,
  zero counts left out).
- Audit (`campaign`): `campaign.create`, `.update`, `.schedule`, `.send`, `.test`, `.cancel`, `.delete` — «Рассылка
  «Осень» запущена: 130 получателей», «Рассылка «Осень» запланирована на 20 октября, 10:00».

### Collecting birthdays
Most cards have no birthday, so greetings rarely go out. The birthday is collected gently, never required:
- **Bot:** right after a chat shares its phone (or links a card) and the card has no birthday and was never asked
  (`birthdayAskedAt` is null), the bot asks once: «Подскажите дату рождения — в этот день пришлём подарок 🎁» with
  «Пропустить». A reply like «12.04.1995», «12 апреля», «12/04», «12 апреля 1995» is saved (`YYYY-MM-DD`; a year-less
  date is stored with year 1900 and shown without the year); anything else gets one gentle retry, then the bot moves
  on. `birthdayAskedAt` is set when it asks, so it never asks again.
- **Booking page / Mini App:** an optional «Дата рождения» on the contacts step for a new client (`birthday` in
  `POST /public/booking`); the engine fills it in when the card has none.
- **Cabinet:** «Добавьте дату рождения — пришлём подарок» while it is empty, `POST /public/cabinet/birthday
  { birthday }` (only when empty; `409` otherwise).
- **App:** the client card shows a hint while the birthday is empty.
- Birthday greetings and the birthday discount ignore the year 1900 placeholder correctly (only day and month count).

### Birthday and win-back
- **Birthday** (`birthday.enabled`): at `sendAt` studio time on the client's birthday (by `birthday`; 29 February
  counts on 28 February in other years), once a year, the bot sends the greeting to linked clients who did not opt out,
  with the gift lines when there are any («🎁 Дарим 500 бонусов — они действуют до 2 ноября» / «💝 Скидка 10% до 26
  октября», «💝 Сегодня — скидка 10%» when `discountDaysAfter` is 0), and credits the gift bonuses (`gift`, burning
  after `bonusDays`: valid through that studio day). The discount itself is applied by staff at checkout from
  `loyalty.birthdayDiscount`; the morning staff digest already names birthdays.
- **Win-back** (`winback.enabled`): daily at `sendAt`, linked clients who did not opt out, whose last completed visit
  was at least `afterMonths` calendar months ago and who have no future `scheduled` / `confirmed` appointment get one
  message per absence (a win-back sent after the last visit covers it; a new visit starts a new period) with
  «📅 Записаться» (as in campaigns: the Mini App or the AI) and the optional gift bonuses («🎁 Дарим 300 бонусов — они
  действуют до 18 ноября»); at most `dailyLimit` a day, the longest absent first.
- Both messages carry «🔕 Не присылать новости» (see «Campaigns»), are stored in the chat as `system`, and go out from
  `sendAt` until 6 hours after it on that studio day (e.g. after a restart). Gift bonuses (and their line) only while
  `loyalty.enabled`; they are credited once the message is delivered — if that fails, the staff chat gets «⚠️ Не
  удалось начислить 500 бонусов в подарок на день рождения клиенту «Анна» (карточка №12) — начислите их вручную».
- Both are logged (`retention_sends`: the birthday by year, the win-back by the date of the last visit) before the
  message goes out, so a restart never repeats them. A failed delivery is tried again the next minute (4 tries in all);
  a client who blocked the bot is not tried again for that year / absence; Telegram's flood limit holds them (and
  campaigns) without counting a try.

### Bot (Telegram + AI)
| Method | Path | Body | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/bot/chats` | — | `{ items: [BotChat] }` sorted by `updatedAt` desc |
| GET | `/bot/chats/:chatId/messages?beforeId=&limit=50` | — | `{ items: [BotMessage] }` ascending by time (the page *before* `beforeId`) |
| POST | `/bot/chats/:chatId/messages` | `{ text }` | `BotMessage` (role `staff`, delivered to Telegram immediately; clears `needsAttention`) |
| POST | `/bot/chats/:chatId/read` | — | `204` (unreadCount → 0, needsAttention → false) |
| PATCH | `/bot/chats/:chatId` | `{ aiPaused }` | `BotChat` |
| PUT | `/bot/chats/:chatId/employee` | `{ "employeeId": 3 }` | `BotChat` with `employee` — binds the chat to that active employee by hand (see Staff chats): the bot sends the staff greeting with the staff keyboard, the staff chat is notified; the chat is bound even if Telegram fails · `404` for an unknown chat · `400` for an unknown or deactivated employee |
| DELETE | `/bot/chats/:chatId/employee` | — | `204` — unlinks the employee: the staff chat becomes an ordinary client chat (`employee: null`; the employee may share the phone again) · `404` for an unknown chat |
| GET | `/bot/scheduled?status=pending` | — | `{ items: [ScheduledMessage] }` sorted by `sendAt` |
| POST | `/bot/scheduled/:id/cancel` | — | `ScheduledMessage` |
| POST | `/bot/staff-code` | — | `{ "code": "482913", "expiresAt": "...", "instruction": "Добавьте бота в рабочий чат и отправьте: /staff 482913" }` |
| POST | `/bot/test` | `{ text }` | `{ "reply": "..." }` — runs the AI with the current knowledge base as an anonymous client, nothing is sent to Telegram |
| GET | `/booking-requests?status=new` | — | `{ items: [BookingRequest] }` newest first |
| PATCH | `/booking-requests/:id` | `{ status }` | `BookingRequest` |
| GET | `/knowledge` | — | `{ items: [KnowledgeEntry] }` |
| POST | `/knowledge` | `{ title, content, active?, sort? }` | `KnowledgeEntry` |
| PATCH | `/knowledge/:id` | any of the above | `KnowledgeEntry` |
| DELETE | `/knowledge/:id` | — | `204` |

Jewelry in the bot: the AI context lists active jewelry that has at least one size in stock, with its category,
material, thread, thickness, colour, stone, suitable services, price (per size when sizes differ in price) and the
names of the sizes in stock — never quantities. `show_products` sends the cover photo with the name, material,
thickness, price and the sizes in stock (jewelry and goods in stock).

#### Client conversation (AI tools)
The AI answers clients warmly and briefly in Russian, only from the studio data (studio info, price list, jewelry in
stock, aftercare memos, knowledge base) and tool results — it never invents prices, availability, free time or
discounts. It consults on every service of the price list (procedure, duration, price and variants, prepayment,
preparation, contraindications, healing, aftercare); when the data has no answer, on medical red flags, complaints or a
request for a human it calls `handoff_to_staff`: the chat gets `needsAttention`, the staff chat is notified, and staff
answer from the app (`POST /bot/chats/:chatId/messages`). Client tools:
- `book_appointment { items: [ { serviceId, variant? } ], masterId?, startsAt, comment? }` — books online for the
  chat's linked client through the engine (see «Online booking», channel `bot`): `startsAt` is studio-local «YYYY-MM-DD
  HH:MM». The model calls it only after the client agreed to the services, the master (or «any») and the time it
  offered from `free_slots`; the result says what happens next (payment link sent as a button, or waiting for
  confirmation) and the model tells the client in plain words. Unidentified chats are asked to share the phone. A taken
  time answers with up to 8 free starts of that day; with online booking off the tool refuses and points to
  `create_booking_request`. The system prompt's booking rule follows `onlineBooking.enabled` (on: book through
  `book_appointment`, requests only for vague wishes; off: requests as before).
- `create_booking_request { contactName, phone, serviceName, preferredTime, comment? }` — a `BookingRequest`; staff
  confirm the time. Used when the client has no exact time in mind or online booking is off.
- `handoff_to_staff { reason }`.
- `show_service { serviceId }` — the service picture with price and variants after the reply (once per conversation).
- `show_products { productIds ≤ 5 }` — photos of pieces in stock.
- `show_jewelry_for_service { serviceId }` — a jewelry carousel of the pieces compatible with the service (see
  Catalogs). The model maps misspelled zones («Феликс» → Хеликс) onto the price list.
- `find_jewelry { query }` — searches active jewelry and goods (name, SKU, category, material, colour, stone, size
  names, thickness, thread, suitable services, description; Russian word forms tolerated), up to 8 matches: sizes in
  stock with prices or «нет в наличии» — never quantities.
- `my_appointments {}` — the upcoming scheduled / confirmed appointments of the client card **linked** to this chat
  (deep link or shared phone; a chat merely attributed to a client, e.g. an old account after re-linking, gets
  nothing): number, time, services, master, status. Unidentified chats are asked to share the phone.
- `free_slots { date, appointmentId?, serviceId?, masterId? }` — free starts on a studio-local date: inside the
  master's working time (see «WorkSchedule»: their own schedule minus breaks, else `StudioSettings.workdayStart`–
  `workdayEnd`; studio timezone), on the `onlineBooking.stepMinutes` grid from the start of their working day, at least
  `onlineBooking.leadMinutes` from now, at most `onlineBooking.horizonDays` ahead, not overlapping the master's
  non-cancelled, non-no-show appointments (online holds included). With `appointmentId` (the client's
  own) its duration and master are used and its own time does not count as busy; else `serviceId` gives the duration
  (default 60 min) and `masterId` one master (default: every active master — employees with `isMaster`, all active
  employees when none is). A master off that day is left out (named «не работает в этот день» when asked for by
  `masterId`).
- `reschedule_appointment { appointmentId, startsAt }` — `startsAt` is studio-local «YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM» (an ISO instant
  with an offset is accepted). Only the linked client's own future `scheduled` / `confirmed` appointments; the new time
  must be ≥ 1 hour from now, ≤ 90 days ahead and inside the master's working time; duration and master are kept, the regular
  overlap check applies (`schedule_conflict` → the model offers another time), pending reminders are rebuilt and the
  staff chat gets «🔁 Клиент … перенёс запись №…» (before → after). The model calls it only after the client chose a
  time. Cancellations are handed to staff.
- `show_portfolio { masterId?, serviceId? }` — up to 5 photos of masters' work with «Мастер: **Фатима** · Хеликс»
  captions, after the reply (see «Portfolio»); the prompt's «## Мастера» lists the masters' ids and works.
- `cabinet_link {}` — the client asks for their cabinet or wants to see their appointments, visit history, bonuses or
  memos themselves: the sign-in message of «Client cabinet» follows the AI's reply (once per reply; the AI writes no
  link itself); an unidentified chat is asked to share the phone; without `PUBLIC_URL` the tool says the cabinet is not
  set up. With no text from the model the bot says «Вот ваш личный кабинет: записи, бонусы и памятки по уходу 👇».
- `certificate_balance { code }` — a gift certificate by its code (case, dashes and spaces ignored): what is left of it
  and until when it is valid, or that it is used / expired / cancelled / unknown — never the buyer. Read-only.
- The client context names the linked client's bonuses while loyalty is on: «Бонусы клиента: 1 200 (1 бонус = 1 ₽,
  ими можно оплатить до 30% чека в студии); 200 из них действуют до 2 ноября.» The model speaks of bonuses only from it.
- **AI quality check** (development, not an API): `server/eval/cases.json` holds ≥ 30 reference client questions
  (prices, aftercare, complications and red flags, booking, jewelry, opening hours, prepayment and cancellation) with
  expectations — words the answer must or must not contain, the tool it should call, whether it hands off to staff.
  `npm run eval:ai` runs them against the configured model with the real prompt and tools in test mode (nothing is
  written or sent) and prints a pass/fail table; run it after every model or prompt change. It costs one AI call per
  case.
- `/bot/test` runs these tools without writing anything (no booking, no reschedule, no messages) and lists what would
  have happened.

#### Catalogs (inline buttons)
- The client keyboard (a linked chat): «💉 Услуги и цены», «💎 Украшения» / «📅 Записаться», «🩹 Уход после
  процедуры» / «👤 Мои записи и бонусы». The last one and `/me` send the cabinet sign-in message without an AI call
  (stored as the client's message and the bot's text, see «Client cabinet»).
- The keyboard buttons «💎 Украшения» / «💉 Услуги и цены» and the `/catalog` command (jewelry) open a menu with
  inline buttons without an AI call (the button text is stored as the client's message, the menu as `[Каталог] …`).
  When there is nothing to show, the message goes to the AI as usual.
- Jewelry menu: the jewelry `CatalogCategory`s (staff order) that have active pieces in stock, plus «Другие» for
  pieces without a registered category, and «💉 Услуги и цены». Service menu: per service category its catalog
  categories in staff order («Пирсинг · Ухо»), then services without a group («Тату», or «Пирсинг · прочее» when the
  category has groups), and «💎 Украшения».
- A category opens a **carousel**: one message (photo + caption, or text when the item has no sendable picture) with
  «◀︎ 2 / 7 ▶︎» (wrapping around), and for jewelry «💍 Хочу это украшение» and «📂 Все украшения»; for services
  «📅 Записаться», «💎 Подходящие украшения» (when compatible pieces are in stock) and «📂 Все услуги». Paging edits
  the same message (photo, caption and buttons); between an item with a photo and one without, the message is
  replaced. The carousel is recomputed from the database on every press (a stale position is clamped).
- Jewelry caption (≤ 1024 chars): heading («💎 Украшения для «Хеликс»» / «💎 Лабрет»), name, material · thread ·
  thickness · colour · stone, «Подходит для: …», a short description and «В наличии:» with each size in stock and its
  price — never quantities. Compatible pieces of a service = active `jewelry` products linked to it
  (`Product.serviceIds` / `Service.jewelryIds`) that have a size in stock.
- «Хочу это украшение»: with two or more sizes in stock the buttons turn into size buttons («8 мм — 1 700 ₽», «◀︎
  Назад»); the choice is stored as the client's message «[Выбрано] Лабрет — 8 мм · 1 700 ₽ (украшение id 12, для
  «Хеликс»)» and the AI continues (offers to book, `create_booking_request` with the piece in the comment). «Записаться»
  stores «[Выбрано] Записаться: Хеликс · 3 000 ₽ (услуга id 5)» the same way. A size sold out meanwhile is refused.
- Button payloads (`callback_data`) carry everything they need (≤ 64 bytes), so buttons keep working after a restart;
  unknown or malformed ones answer «Эта кнопка устарела».

#### Reminder buttons
Every reminder carries «✅ Приду» and «🔁 Перенести». Only the client of the appointment, in the chat linked to their
card, can use them, and only while it is a future `scheduled` / `confirmed` appointment (otherwise the buttons are
removed: «Эта запись уже неактуальна»). A button under a message Telegram no longer shows to the bot (older than about
48 hours) answers with a new message instead of editing the old one.
- «✅ Приду» — `scheduled` → `confirmed` (pending reminders are rebuilt), the bot thanks the client, the staff chat
  gets «✅ … подтвердил(а) запись №…», and only «🔁 Перенести» stays under the reminder. Stored as «[Кнопка] ✅ Приду» +
  the bot's reply (no AI call).
- «🔁 Перенести» — stored as the client's message «[Кнопка] 🔁 Хочу перенести запись №…: <when> — <services>»; the AI
  continues with `my_appointments` / `free_slots` / `reschedule_appointment`.

#### Cancellation rules in the bot
The client AI knows `StudioSettings.cancellation` and tells it when a booking with a prepayment is made or asked about
(«Бесплатно отменить или перенести запись можно не позднее чем за 24 часа; при более поздней отмене предоплата не
возвращается, при неявке — тоже»; percents below 100 are named as a share). A reminder of an appointment that holds a
prepayment while a free cancellation is still possible adds «Бесплатно отменить можно до <day>, <time>». Rescheduling
through the bot is not limited by these rules.

#### Follow-ups
When a visit is completed (`complete`, or a sale that completes it), its client has Telegram linked and the bot
allowed, and the bot is on (`BotSettings.enabled`), the server schedules one of each, at `BotSettings.aftercareHour`
studio time on that day. They do not depend on `sendAftercare` and are not counted in `scheduledMessages`; a moment
already past is skipped:
- `healing_check` — after the largest `healingCheckDays` among the visit's catalog services (none set → none):
  «Здравствуйте, Анна! Прошла неделя после процедуры «Хеликс». Как заживает? 🙂» with the buttons «👍 Всё хорошо» and
  «🤔 Есть вопрос».
  - «👍 Всё хорошо» → stored «[Кнопка] 👍 Всё хорошо»; the bot thanks and, when `StudioSettings.reviewLinks` has any,
    asks for a review with a URL button per link («⭐ Яндекс Карты», «⭐ 2ГИС», «⭐ Google»).
  - «🤔 Есть вопрос» → stored «[Кнопка] 🤔 Есть вопрос по заживлению»; the bot asks to describe it and send a photo, the
    chat gets `needsAttention`, the staff chat is notified («🩹 Анна: вопрос по заживлению после «Хеликс», запись №…»).
- `jewelry_change` — after the smallest `jewelryChangeWeeks` among the visit's catalog services (none set → none):
  «Анна, прошло 6 недель после прокола «Хеликс» — самое время заменить украшение на подходящее по размеру. Записаться?»
  with «📅 Записаться» (stored «[Кнопка] 📅 Хочу записаться на замену украшения после «Хеликс»», the AI continues the
  booking) and «Позже» (a short reply, no AI).
Only the appointment's client, in the chat linked to their card, can use these buttons; the buttons are removed once
one is pressed («Позже» leaves «📅 Записаться»). After «🤔 Есть вопрос» the AI keeps answering the client as usual.
Completing a visit again schedules nothing new; a follow-up is cancelled if the client unlinks Telegram or turns the
bot off for themselves, and skipped if the visit is no longer `completed` when it is due.

#### Alerts
The staff chat (bound with `/staff`; else every staff chat) is told when something needs a person: the AI provider
refuses for lack of balance («⚠️ Закончился баланс ИИ (Polza) — бот отвечает заглушкой»), the AI fails several times
in a row, a daily backup or its off-site copy fails, free disk space runs low. Each kind at most once every 6 hours,
and once more when it recovers.

#### Formatting
Bot messages may use light Markdown that the server renders for Telegram (HTML parse mode): `**bold**`, a heading
line `# …` / `## …` (shown bold), list lines starting with `- ` or `* ` (shown as `• `), `` `code` ``. Everything else
is plain text (`<`, `>`, `&` are escaped). If Telegram rejects the markup the text is sent plain, markers stripped.
`BotMessage.text` keeps the raw text: apps render `**bold**` and strip the other markers. The AI is told to format
with short paragraphs, blank lines between blocks, «•» lists and **bold** only for the key facts (2–3 per client
message); staff answers use emoji block headers in bold.

#### Staff digests
Twice a day the bot sends every staff chat (a chat bound to an active employee) a summary, built from the data
without the AI (no AI cost), personalised with the employee's name (their own appointments are marked «вы»):
- **Morning** (`morningDigestAt`): today's appointments with time, client, services, master and total, the expected
  revenue; «Обратить внимание»: prepayments still awaited for today and tomorrow, unpaid past visits (last 30 days),
  open receipts left from earlier days, new booking requests, chats waiting for staff, low stock, the cash shift
  (yesterday's left open / none open), clients with a birthday among today's visits — or «Всё спокойно»; tomorrow's
  count and first appointment.
- **Evening** (`eveningDigestAt`): revenue of the day with the number of sales, the average check and the payment
  split (with bonuses and gift certificates when there were any), certificates sold, refunds; visits done / no-shows / cancelled; today's visits left unpaid; open receipts; the open cash shift
  with the expected cash («не забудьте закрыть»); tomorrow's appointments and prepayments still awaited for them.
Each digest is sent once per studio day when its time comes (not later than 3 hours after it, e.g. after a server
restart), only while the bot is running; it is stored in the chat as an `assistant` message.

#### Staff chats
- An employee is recognised when they share **their own** contact with the bot (the «📱 Поделиться номером» button):
  the contact's `user_id` must equal the sender's Telegram id (a forwarded contact card is refused, as Telegram sets
  `user_id` to the owner of the number) and the normalized phone must equal the phone of an **active** employee. The
  chat gets `employee`, is greeted as staff with a staff keyboard («📋 Что сегодня», «📊 Выручка за неделю», «📦 Что
  заканчивается», «💎 Украшения») and the staff chat is notified («🔑 … подключил(а) Telegram к боту как сотрудник»).
  No client card is created. Sharing any other phone later makes the chat a client chat again. The `/staff` group
  binding is never affected.
- Phones are compared normalized (see `normalizePhone`): Telegram's `phone_number` comes as `79931234567` or
  `+79931234567`, the profile phone may be written `8 (993) 123-45-67`, `+7 993 123 45 67`, `9931234567` — all match.
- **Sharing the phone is required.** Telegram never gives a bot the user's phone by itself, so a private chat that is
  neither linked to a client nor a staff chat can do nothing else until it shares its own contact:
  - `/start` appends to the greeting «Чтобы начать, нажмите «📱 Поделиться номером» внизу 👇 Так я найду вас в нашей
    базе или запишу как нового клиента. Сотрудников студии узнаю по номеру из профиля в MIKAN.»; the keyboard under
    the input field has only that button until the phone is shared.
  - Any other message (text, keyboard buttons, photos, files, voice, stickers) is stored for staff and answered — with
    no AI call — «Чтобы я мог помочь, нажмите «📱 Поделиться номером» внизу 👇 Это нужно сделать один раз.»; inline
    buttons answer «Сначала поделитесь номером — кнопка внизу 👇».
  - The shared phone of a client in the base links that client to the chat (and stores the Telegram nick); a new
    phone creates a client with the Telegram name (first / last name from the contact), the phone, the nick and source
    `telegram`. The client keyboard appears, and what the person asked before sharing the phone is answered by the AI
    right away. A deep link from the client card (`/start c…`) links the chat without the phone.
- The client AI, when
  someone says they work at the studio or asks to be recognised, points to the same button (a typed number does not
  count; a chat already linked to a client has no such button — staff then bind it in the app) and never claims to
  have recognised them.
- A refused contact leaves a `system` message in the chat: «Контакт не принят: прислана чужая карточка контакта
  (+7…), а не свой номер. …» or «Контакт не принят: не удалось распознать номер «…». …».
- Binding by hand: `PUT /bot/chats/:chatId/employee { employeeId }` (an active employee) makes any chat that
  employee's staff chat — for employees who never shared their phone. The bot sends the staff greeting with the staff
  keyboard (stored as a `system` message when delivered; a delivery failure is logged, the chat is bound anyway) and the
  staff chat gets «🔑 <name> подключён(а) к боту как сотрудник (вручную, @username)». Binding the chat to the employee
  it already belongs to sends nothing. `DELETE` undoes it.
- Staff mode is checked on every message: only while the employee is active (deactivation removes it at once).
  The AI then uses a staff system prompt (studio info and price list, the employee's name, the masters) and staff tools
  only — client tools are not offered, and client chats never get the staff tools (a client chat calling one gets
  «Неизвестный инструмент»):
  - `today {}` — today's appointments of all masters, sales today with the payment split, refunds, the cash shift and
    expected cash, new booking requests, chats waiting for staff, low stock count.
  - `appointments { from, to?, masterId?, clientQuery?, status? }` — studio-local dates (`to` inclusive, ≤ 62 days),
    every master: client and phone, master, service lines with prices, total, status, prepayment, payment, title, notes
    (`status`: an appointment status or `active`); up to 60 rows plus totals.
  - `client_info { query }` — up to 3 matching client cards (name, last name, phone, nick): contacts, Telegram, notes,
    visits, total spent, last visit, upcoming appointments, the last 10 services and purchases.
  - `analytics { from, to }` — `GET /reports/summary` for the studio-local days (≤ 400 days): revenue, sales,
    average check, refunds, payment split, services vs products, prepayments, top 10 services and products (with sizes),
    by master, new clients, completed appointments, no-shows, revenue by day (≤ 31 days).
  - `stock { query?, lowOnly? }` — active products of every kind with the stock of each size in units, minimums,
    prices; presence consumables by status; `lowOnly` — sizes at or below the minimum and presence status not `ok`.
  Staff answers may name quantities, money and any client's data. Staff chats are never escalated (`needsAttention`
  stays false); when the AI is off or the limit is reached they get «ИИ-помощник сейчас недоступен…».
- AI cost guards (daily and per-chat hourly limits) apply to staff chats too.
